        "title": "OpenAI tempers expectations with less bombastic, GPT-5-less DevDay this fall",
        "text": "Last year, OpenAI held a splashy press event in San Francisco during which the company announced a bevy of new products and tools, including the ill-fated App Store-like GPT Store.\n\nThis year will be a quieter affair, however. On Monday, OpenAI said it\u2019s changing the format of its DevDay conference from a tentpole event into a series of on-the-road developer engagement sessions. The company also confirmed that it wouldn\u2019t release its next major flagship model during DevDay, instead focusing on updates to its APIs and developer services.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not planning to announce our next model at DevDay,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019ll be focused more on educating developers about what\u2019s available and showcasing dev community stories.\u201d\n\nOpenAI\u2019s DevDay events this year will take place in San Francisco on October 1, London on October 30 and Singapore on November 1. All will feature workshops, breakout sessions, demos with the OpenAI product and engineering staff and developer spotlights. Registration will cost $450 (or $0 through scholarships available for eligible attendees), with applications to close on August 15.\n\nOpenAI has in recent months taken more incremental steps than monumental leaps in generative AI, opting to hone and fine-tune its tools as it trains the successor to its current leading models GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini. The company has refined approaches to improving the overall performance of its models and preventing those models from going off the rails as often as much as they previously did, but OpenAI appears to have lost its technical lead in the generative AI race \u2014 at least according to some benchmarks.\n\nOne of the reasons could be the increasing challenge of finding high-quality training data.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s models, like most generative AI models, are trained on massive collections of web data \u2014 web data that many creators are choosing to gate over fears that their data will be plagiarized or that they won\u2019t receive credit or pay. More than 35% of the world\u2019s top 1,000 websites now block OpenAI\u2019s web crawler, according to data from Originality.AI. And around 25% of data from \u201chigh-quality\u201d sources has been restricted from the major data sets used to train AI models, a study by MIT\u2019s Data Provenance Initiative found.\n\nShould the current access-blocking trend continue, the research group Epoch AI predicts that developers will run out of data to train generative AI models between 2026 and 2032. That \u2014 and fear of copyright lawsuits \u2014 has forced OpenAI to ink costly licensing agreements with publishers and various data brokers.\n\nOpenAI is said to have developed a reasoning technique that could improve its models\u2019 responses on certain questions, particularly math questions, and the company\u2019s CTO Mira Murati has promised a future model with \u201cPh.D.-level\u201d intelligence. That\u2019s pledging a lot \u2014 and there\u2019s high pressure to deliver. OpenAI\u2019s reportedly hemorrhaging billions of dollars training its models and hiring top-paid research staff.\n\nTime will tell whether OpenAI can deliver while dealing with the many, many controversies that plague it. In any case, the slower product cycle might have the beneficial side effect of countering the narrative that OpenAI has deprioritized work on AI safety in the pursuit of more capable, powerful generative AI technologies.",

        "title": "Google loses massive antitrust case over search, will appeal ruling",
        "text": "Google will appeal a U.S. District Court judge\u2019s opinion Monday that found the technology giant acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search.\n\nThe decision from Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is a major defeat for Google that could alter the way it does business and even change the structure of the internet as we know it, should the decision stand.\n\nMehta said that Google abused its monopoly power over the search business in part by paying companies like Apple to present its search engine as the default choice on their devices and web browsers. The Justice Department and states filed the antitrust suit against Google in 2020, which kicked off in court in September 2023.\n\nGoogle pays companies including Apple, Samsung and Mozilla billions of dollars for prime placement in web browsers and on smartphones. In 2021 alone, Google spent $26 billion to be the default search engine across Apple and Android platforms. According to The New York Times, about $18 billion of that spend went to Apple alone. Google shares 36% of search ad revenue from Safari with Apple. The government has argued that paying for the dominant position effectively kneecapped competitors from being able to build up their own search engines to a scale that would give them the data and reach to stay competitive.\n\n\u201cAfter having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\u201d Mehta wrote in his opinion filed Monday. \u201cIt has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\u201d\n\nSection 2 of the Sherman Act makes it illegal for any person or business to monopolize, attempt to monopolize or conspire to monopolize any part of trade or commerce.\n\nKent Walker, Google\u2019s president of Global Affairs, told TechCrunch the company plans to appeal the decision. Walker doubled down on Google\u2019s previous arguments that it has used its dominant position to make the best and most useful search engine, which has benefited consumers and advertisers alike.\n\n\u201cThis decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn\u2019t be allowed to make it easily available,\u201d Walker told TechCrunch. \u201cWe appreciate the Court\u2019s finding that Google is \u2018the industry\u2019s highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users\u2019, that Google \u2018has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices\u2019, \u2018has continued to innovate in search\u2019 and that \u2018Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google\u2019s search quality relative to its rivals and find Google\u2019s to be superior.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe opinion caps off a years-long case \u2014 U.S. et al. v. Google \u2014 that resulted in a 10-week trial last year. The Department of Justice and a group of attorneys general from 38 states and territories, led by Colorado and Nebraska, filed similar but separate antitrust suits against Google in 2020, alleging that Google unfairly blocked out would-be search rivals like Bing and DuckDuckGo. The Department of Justice estimated that Google had a 90% share of the search market, a figure that Google disputed.\n\nThe outcome of the case is a significant win for the Justice Department in an election year when former president Donald Trump would, should he win a second term in office, almost certainly take a decidedly more hands-off, deregulatory approach to tech. President Joe Biden\u2019s pick to lead the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, has garnered a reputation for coming after big tech, particularly in regards to antitrust law, that many of those companies have not taken kindly to.\n\nThis case could set precedent for the raft of other antitrust lawsuits making their way through the courts today. The DOJ has sued Apple for making it difficult for consumers to switch away from the iPhone. The FTC has also recently sued Meta for stamping out early competitors and Amazon for squeezing sellers on its online marketplace.\n\nJudge Mehta\u2019s decision Monday may also impact the outcome of the Justice Department\u2019s second antitrust suit against Google, which alleges that Google illegally monopolized the digital ads market. Arguments for that case are scheduled to begin September 9.\n\nThe judge has yet to decide remedies for Google\u2019s behavior. He could force the company to change the way it runs its search business \u2014 or order it to sell off parts of that business. The opinion could be appealed, of course, and the final verdict may differ significantly, as happened with Microsoft\u2019s famed antitrust case in the dot-com era.\n\nIn that case, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft violated antitrust laws and ordered the company to be split into two entities. Microsoft appealed the decision, and an appeals court overturned the breakup order, but Microsoft still had to take certain steps that experts today say might influence Mehta\u2019s behavioral remedies for Google. As part of Microsoft\u2019s settlement, the company had to share its APIs with third-party companies and appoint a panel to monitor its compliance.\n\nUpdate: This article was originally published August 5 at 12:20 pm PT. It has been updated with more context and information from Google.",

        "text": "Saudi Arabia is committing even more money to Lucid Motors as the EV startup struggles to erase its losses. Lucid announced Monday as part of its second-quarter earnings report that an affiliate of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund is committing another $1.5 billion, with half coming in the form of a private placement and the other half as a loan facility.\n\nThe deal also further deepens the ties between Lucid and its majority owner, which has already committed to buying at least 50,000 of its EVs in the coming years, and is helping the company build a brand new factory in the Kingdom.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time Lucid has turned to Saudi Arabia for more money since Lucid\u2019s CEO Peter Rawlinson told the Financial Times in a March 2024 interview that he was wary of being over-reliant on the Kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. \u201cIf I adopt a mindset that there is bottomless wealth from PIF, that is very dangerous, that is something I will never do, I respect them far too much for that,\u201d he told the financial outlet.\n\nThe new funding comes as Lucid announced it lost $643 million in the second quarter of 2024, despite setting a new sales record for its electric luxury sedans that generated $200 million of revenue. Lucid reported it had $1.35 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter.\n\nLucid doesn\u2019t just need money to staunch the bleeding as it tries to carve out a market for its luxury sedan, the Air. It also needs capital to help with the upcoming launch of its first electric SUV, known as Gravity. Lucid has said the Gravity will enter production by the end of 2024 and has put its hopes on it becoming a success in North America given the popularity of the form factor in the region. The company laid off about 400 employees, or roughly 6% of its workforce, in May 2024 as part of a restructuring ahead of the launch of the Gravity SUV.",

        "title": "AI chip startup Groq lands $640M to challenge Nvidia",
        "text": "Groq, a startup developing chips to run generative AI models faster than conventional processors, said on Monday that it has raised $640 million in a new funding round led by Blackrock. Neuberger Berman, Type One Ventures, Cisco, KDDI and Samsung Catalyst Fund also participated.\n\nThe tranche, which brings Groq\u2019s total raised to over $1 billion and values the company at $2.8 billion, is a major win for Groq, which reportedly was originally looking to raise $300 million at a slightly lower ($2.5 billion) valuation. It more than doubles Groq\u2019s previous valuation (~$1 billion) in April 2021, when the company raised $300 million in a round led by Tiger Global Management and D1 Capital Partners.\n\nMeta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun will serve as a technical advisor to Groq and Stuart Pann, the former head of Intel\u2019s foundry business and ex-CIO at HP, will join the startup as chief operating officer, Groq also announced today. LeCun\u2019s appointment is a bit unexpected, given Meta\u2019s investments in its own AI chips \u2014 but it undoubtedly gives Groq a powerful ally in a cutthroat space.\n\nGroq, which emerged from stealth in 2016, is creating what it calls an LPU (language processing unit) inference engine. The company claims its LPUs can run existing generative AI models similar in architecture to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and GPT-4o at 10x the speed and one-tenth the energy.\n\nGroq CEO Jonathan Ross\u2019 claim to fame is helping to invent the tensor processing unit (TPU), Google\u2019s custom AI accelerator chip used to train and run models. Ross teamed up with Douglas Wightman, an entrepreneur and former engineer at Google parent company Alphabet\u2019s X moonshot lab, to co-found Groq close to a decade ago.\n\nGroq provides an LPU-powered developer platform called GroqCloud that offers \u201copen\u201d models like Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1 family, Google\u2019s Gemma, OpenAI\u2019s Whisper and Mistral\u2019s Mixtral, as well as an API that allows customers to use its chips in cloud instances. (Groq also hosts a playground for AI-powered chatbots, GroqChat, that it launched late last year.) As of July, GroqCloud had more than 356,000 developers; Groq says that a portion of the proceeds from the round will be used to scale capacity and add new models and features.\n\n\u201cMany of these developers are at large enterprises,\u201d Stuart Pann, Groq\u2019s COO, told TechCrunch. \u201cBy our estimates, over 75% of the Fortune 100 are represented.\u201d\n\nA close-up look at Groq\u2019s LPU, which is designed to accelerate certain AI workloads. Image Credits: Groq\n\nAs the generative AI boom continues, Groq faces increasing competition from both rival AI chip upstarts and Nvidia, the formidable incumbent in the AI hardware sector.\n\nNvidia controls an estimated 70% to 95% of the market for AI chips used to train and deploy generative AI models, and the firm\u2019s taking aggressive steps to maintain its dominance.\n\nNvidia has committed to releasing a new AI chip architecture every year, rather than every other year as was the case historically. And it\u2019s reportedly establishing a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for cloud computing firms and others, including AI hardware.\n\nBeyond Nvidia, Groq competes with Amazon, Google and Microsoft, all of which offer \u2014 or will soon offer \u2014 custom chips for AI workloads in the cloud. Amazon has its Trainium, Inferentia and Graviton processors, available through AWS; Google Cloud customers can use the aforementioned TPUs and, in time, Google\u2019s Axion chip; and Microsoft recently launched Azure instances in preview for its Cobalt 100 CPU, with Maia 100 AI Accelerator instances to come in the next several months.\n\nGroq could consider Arm, Intel, AMD and a growing number of startups as rivals, too, in an AI chip market that could reach $400 billion in annual sales in the next five years, according to some analysts. Arm and AMD in particular have blossoming AI chip businesses, thanks to soaring capital spending by cloud vendors to meet the capacity demand for generative AI.\n\nD-Matrix late last year raised $110 million to commercialize what it\u2019s characterizing as a first-of-its-kind inference compute platform. In June, Etched emerged from stealth with $120 million for a processor custom-built to speed up the dominant generative AI model architecture today, the transformer. SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son is reportedly looking to raise $100 billion for a chip venture to compete Nvidia. And OpenAI is said to be in talks with investment firms to launch an AI chip-making initiative.\n\nTo carve out its niche, Groq is investing heavily in enterprise and government outreach.\n\nIn March, Groq acquired Definitive Intelligence, a Palo Alto-based firm offering a range of business-oriented AI solutions, to form a new business unit called Groq Systems. Within Groq Systems\u2019 purview is serving organizations, including U.S. government agencies and sovereign nations, that wish to add Groq\u2019s chips to existing data centers or build new data centers using Groq processors.\n\nMore recently, Groq partnered with Carahsoft, a government IT contractor, to sell its solutions to public sector clients through Carahsoft\u2019s reseller partners, and the startup has a letter of intent to install tens of thousands of its LPUs at European firm Earth Wind & Power\u2019s Norway data center.\n\nGroq is also collaborating with Saudi Arabian consulting firm Aramco Digital to install LPUs in future data centers in the Middle East.\n\nAt the same time it\u2019s establishing customer relationships, Mountain View, California-based Groq is marching toward the next generation of its chip. Last August, the company announced that it would contract with Samsung\u2019s foundry business to manufacture 4nm LPUs, which are expected to deliver performance and efficiency gains over Groq\u2019s first-gen 13nm chips.\n\nGroq says it plans to deploy more than 108,000 LPUs by the end of Q1 2025.",

        "text": "We\u2019re so excited to announce that we\u2019ve added a dedicated AI Stage presented by Google Cloud to TechCrunch Disrupt 2024. It joins Fintech, SaaS and Space as the other industry-focused stages \u2014 all under one big roof.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t possibly host TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 without a huge deep dive on all things artificial intelligence. So, here is our first sneak peek at the AI Stage agenda, happening all day on Wednesday, October 30. As a classic TechCrunch stage, we have some of the nascent industry\u2019s heavy hitters, like Alexandr Wang and Aravind Srinivas, alongside our partners like Nebius AI and others!\n\nCheck the prelim agenda below and keep checking back for updates \u2014 we have a lot more to add to the AI Stage.\n\nThe AI Stage agenda at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024\n\nFrom Search Engines to Knowledge Engines: Perplexity\u2019s Rush Toward an AI-Curated Web\n\nwith Aravind Srinivas (Perplexity)\n\nPerplexity\u2018s AI-powered search engine might be the next stage of interacting with the web and knowledge in general \u2014 or not. But the company is certainly risking it all to manifest that future, even if it ruffles a few feathers along the way. Hear from the CEO how the company plans to take on all comers in this new category of tech.\n\nThe Business of Labeling: A Deep Dive into Scale AI\u2019s Massive Growth\n\nwith Alexandr Wang (Scale AI)\n\nIn 2016, when Scale AI was founded, few people could have predicted that the company, which builds tools to train, test and maintain generative AI models, would eventually grow into a $14 billion business. In hindsight, it seems almost inevitable that Scale would, well, scale quickly, given the dramatic growth many of its early customers, including OpenAI, experienced. In a conversation with Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang, we\u2019ll discuss the company\u2019s journey so far and the role that Scale AI now plays in the generative AI ecosystem.\n\nHow Generative AI Is Flooding the Web with Disinformation\n\nwith Pamela San Martin (Oversight Board), Imran Ahmed (CCDH), and speakers to be announced\n\nAs generative AI tools become more widely available \u2014 and become cheaper, or even free, to use \u2014 they\u2019re being abused by an array of actors, including state actors, to create deepfakes and sow disinformation online. In this session, we\u2019ll hear from experts about the types of deepfakes now circulating the web and some possible ways to combat the threat.\n\nAre \u201cOpen\u201d AI Models Really Better?\n\nwith Ali Farhadi (Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence), Irene Solaiman (Hugging Face), and speakers to be announced\n\nThere\u2019s a war brewing in the AI industry between companies in support of \u201copen\u201d AI models (models released under permissive licenses that can be fine-tuned and repurposed for a range of applications) and closed source models (models gated behind paid services and APIs). Is one approach better than the other? The answer isn\u2019t as clear-cut as you might think. In this talk, we\u2019ll investigate the differences between open and closed source models, as well as the subtle but important flavors of open-model licenses.\n\nNavigating AI\u2019s Legal and Ethical Minefield\n\nwith Sarah Myers West (AI Now), Jingna Zhang (Cara), and Ben Zhao (University of Chicago)\n\nAI\u2019s meteoric rise has created new ethical dilemmas and exacerbated old ones, while lawsuits drop left and right. This threatens both new and established AI companies, and the creators and workers whose labor feeds the models.

        "text": "Location data, for better or worse, continues to be a part of the bedrock of how apps are built. Now a startup developing AI market research based on that location data, Placer.ai, has quietly raised $75 million at an expanded valuation of nearly $1.5 billion, TechCrunch has learned.\n\nThe startup provides a wide range of location-based analytics to companies in verticals like retail, events and entertainment, CPG, retail estate, financial services and healthcare by combining AI with anonymized data that it sources from third-party apps.\n\nWe first became aware of the funding by way of a Form D filed in July detailing Placer\u2019s intentions to raise $75 million. We have confirmed with the company\u2019s CEO and CFO that it has closed the full amount, with a new valuation of $1.45 billion, up nearly 50% since its last round, a $100 million Series C made at a $1 billion valuation.\n\nThe investment underscores the growing value of location data for businesses beyond the app publishers themselves. And, at a time when more people are aware of data protection around mobile apps, not least due to a growing number of data breaches, it also serves as a reminder of just how much data we generate through modern life.\n\nPlacer\u2019s analytics cover general trends like foot traffic at a particular location or for a particular store \u2014 factoids like Aldi currently ranking as the fastest-growing retailer based on visits \u2014 but also more detailed data about who buys what and and when, people\u2019s demographic profiles and more.\n\nSuch methods are a little creepy, as some have noted, but also not totally uncommon. (Others that track location data include Foursquare, Esri and many others offer location analytics.)\n\nLike other mobile analytics firms, the startup picks up data by way of an SDK that it installs with hundreds of app publishers, as well as through other third-party sources. It describes itself as a \u201cprivacy by design\u201d business: All of the data it uses is anonymized before it comes to Placer, the company said.\n\nThe company declined to disclose specific participants in this latest fundraise except to note that existing backers participated. PitchBook notes that real estate investment firm GEM Realty Capital is also in this most recent round.\n\nOverall, Placer has more than 50 investors \u2014 both firms and individuals \u2014 on its cap table. They include Josh Buckley (the former CEO of Product Hunt), WndrCo (Jeffrey Katzenberg\u2019s investment firm), Lachy Groom, MMC Technology Ventures, Fifth Wall Ventures and Array Ventures, alongside J.M. Schapiro (CEO of Continental Realty Corp), Eliot Bencuya and Jeff Karsh of Tryperion Partners, Daniel Klein of Klein Enterprises/Sundeck Capital and Majestic Realty.\n\nNumbers have been strong for the company. Placer\u2019s CEO and co-founder Noam Ben-Zvi told TechCrunch in an interview that the company crossed an annual revenue run rate of $100 million in February, and it has grown 80% in the last year and expects to grow another 60% this year. It has also passed 4,300 customers (up from 1,000 in 2022 when it raised the $100 million). The list includes the likes of Sony, various city development organizations, Wegmans, and Century 21.\n\n\u201cWhat ties them together is that they all have a stake in the physical world,\u201d he said.\n\nThe funding was raised based on inbound interest, CFO Dean Nese said. The plan will be to use the funding for business development and to add more features and datasets to the platform. It says it already provides users with \u201chundreds\u201d of these datasets.\n\nPlacer was founded in 2018 by Ben-Zvi and fellow Israelis Zohar Bar-Yehuda (data scientist), Oded Fossfeld (CTO) and Ofir Lemel (CPO), and it was just two years later that the company faced what you might assume would be a death knell for a location analytics company: the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic and the world turning away from physical gatherings. It turned out to be the opposite.\n\nAt an especially restricted time, Ben-Zvi said, \u201cOur data provided a lot of visibility into what was working and what was not working.\u201d\n\nHaving that foothold with customers meant that the company expanded its reach along with the world \u201creopening\u201d for business.\n\nWhile Placer has always used machine learning and inference to build more detailed profiles based on the data that they glean from apps, that has now also been a strong point with its end users, who have been given a green light to explore how to build more AI into their workflows.\n\n\u201cCustomers want a holistic one-stop-shop platform for market research,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may ask themselves: Should I expand to this market? How are my competitors doing? What they want is all the underlying data that\u2019s relevant, and all the aggregations and the tools on top. Analytics is a core ingredient.\u201d",

        "text": "A YouTube creator is seeking to bring a class action lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging that the company trained its generative AI models on millions of transcripts from YouTube videos without notifying or compensating the videos\u2019 owners.\n\nIn a complaint filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, attorneys for David Millette, a YouTube user based in Massachusetts, allege that OpenAI surreptitiously transcribed Millette\u2019s and other creators\u2019 videos to train the models that power the company\u2019s AI-powered chatbot platform, ChatGPT, and other generative AI tools and products. By collecting this data, OpenAI \u201cprofited significantly\u201d from the creators\u2019 work, the complaint alleges, while violating copyright law and YouTube\u2019s terms of service that prohibit the use of videos for apps independent of its service.\n\n\u201cAs [OpenAI\u2019s] AI products become more sophisticated through the use of training data sets, they become more valuable to prospective and current users, who purchase subscriptions to access [OpenAI\u2019s] AI products,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cMuch of the material in OpenAI\u2019s training data sets, however, comes from works that were copied by OpenAI without consent, without credit, and without compensation.\u201d\n\nMillette, represented by the law firm Bursor & Fisher, is seeking a jury trial and over $5 million in damages for all YouTube users and creators whose data might\u2019ve been swept up in OpenAI\u2019s training.\n\nGenerative AI models like OpenAI\u2019s have no real intelligence. Fed an enormous number of examples (e.g. movies, voice recordings, essays and so on), models \u201clearn\u201d how likely data is to occur based on patterns, including the context of any surrounding data.\n\nMost models are trained on data sourced from public websites and data sets around the web. Companies argue that fair use shields their efforts to scrape data indiscriminately and use it for training commercial models. Many copyright holders disagree, however \u2014 and they\u2019re filing suits aimed at halting practice.\n\nVideo transcriptions have become a key training data ingredient as other data wells dry up, so to speak.\n\nMore than 35% of the world\u2019s top 1,000 websites now block OpenAI\u2019s web crawler, according to data from Originality.AI. And around 25% of data from \u201chigh-quality\u201d sources has been restricted from the major data sets used to train AI models, a study by MIT\u2019s Data Provenance Initiative found. Should the current access-blocking trend continue, the research group Epoch AI predicts that developers will run out of data to train generative AI models between 2026 and 2032.\n\nIn April, The New York Times reported that OpenAI created its first speech recognition model, Whisper, for the purpose of transcribing audio from videos to collect additional training data. An OpenAI team that included company\u2019s president, Greg Brockman, transcribed more than a million hours of video from YouTube using Whisper, according to The Times, and used the transcripts to train OpenAI\u2019s text-generating and -analyzing model GPT-4.\n\nSome OpenAI staffers discussed how such a move might go against YouTube\u2019s rules, per the Times.\n\nIn July, Proof News reported that companies including Anthropic, Apple, Salesforce and Nvidia used a data set called The Pile, which contains subtitles from hundreds of thousands of YouTube videos, to train generative AI models. Many YouTube creators whose subtitles were swept up in The Pile weren\u2019t aware of and didn\u2019t consent to this; Apple later released a statement saying that it didn\u2019t intend to use those models to power any AI features in its products.\n\nGoogle, YouTube\u2019s parent company, has also sought to use transcripts to train its models.\n\nLast year, Google broadened its terms of service (ToS) partly to allow the company to tap more user data for generative AI model training. Under the old ToS, it wasn\u2019t clear whether Google could use YouTube data to build products beyond the video platform. Not so under the new terms, which loosen the reins considerably.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to OpenAI and Google for comment on the class action suit and will update this piece if they respond.\n\nIt\u2019s been a rough start to the month for OpenAI.\n\nTesla and X CEO Elon Musk on Monday filed a new suit against OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman accusing the company of abandoning its original nonprofit mission by reserving some of its most sophisticated tech for commercial customers. Musk made the same claims in a February lawsuit against OpenAI, but the new suit alleges that OpenAI is engaging in racketeering activity, as well.",

The reason for that growth is probably new versions of the iPad Air and iPad Pro, which were announced in May. Turns out that if Apple actually invests in iPads, they sell.\n\nIn contrast, global iPhone sales were down for the second quarter in a row, falling to $39.3 billion. As you can tell by comparing those numbers, smartphones are still a lot more important to Apple\u2019s bottom line.\n\nSo why are iPhone sales down? Apple\u2019s biggest challenge seems to be in China, which is its third largest market, and a country where iPhones face growing competition from Chinese companies like Huawei.

        "title": "We\u2019re about to get the most detailed explanation yet for Boeing\u2019s terrifying mid-air blowout",
        "text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nThe public already knows a lot about the January 5 Alaska Airlines flight that had a door plug blow out of the side of a Boeing 737 Max as it approached 16,000 feet. We\u2019re potentially about to find out a lot more.\n\nThe incident left a gaping hole in the side of the plane, sending oxygen masks falling from the ceiling, tearing off clothing and ripping phones out of passengers\u2019 hands and hurling them into the darkness.\n\nFortunately, the crew was able to land the crippled jet without any serious injuries. It was a combination of the skill of the flight crew and good luck that no one was killed. The accident did do serious damage to the public\u2019s confidence in plane manufacturer Boeing, prompting a series of federal investigations into its practices and the safety and quality of its aircraft.\n\nOne of those investigations is being conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board, the federal regulator that investigates all manner of accidents, from railroad derailments to some car crashes to virtually all plane crashes.\n\nThe NTSB is scheduled to hold 20 hours of public hearings about the Alaska Airlines incident spread over two days, starting Tuesday morning. It will begin by making public a docket of more than 60 documents running more than 3,800 pages that have been collected in the seven months since the accident. Then will come testimony from NTSB staff investigators and questions from the members of the safety board.\n\nMissing bolts \u2014 and missing paperwork\n\nThe NTSB has already released preliminary findings from the incident, disclosing that the plane used on the flight left the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, 10 weeks earlier and without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place.\n\nSince that report, Boeing has said the reasons for that oversight came down to something as simple as a lack of paperwork.\n\nWhen the fuselage of the plane arrived at the Boeing factory from supplier Spirit AeroSystems, the door plug was in place, as were the four bolts meant to hold it securely attached to the side of the jet. But there were problems with five rivets near where the door plug was installed, and Boeing workers removed the door plug in order to fix those rivets.\n\nAccording to Boeing, the workers who fixed the rivets didn\u2019t generate the paperwork indicating they had removed the door plug and the four bolts in order to do that work.\n\nWhen a different group of employees put the plug back in place, Boeing says the employees didn\u2019t think the plane would actually fly in that condition. Instead, they were just blocking the hole with the plug to protect the inside of the fuselage from weather as the plane moved outside to a different area of the factory compound. That group of employees often makes those kind of temporary fixes.\n\nThose employees likely assumed paperwork existed showing that the plug and bolts had been removed, and that paperwork would prompt someone else along the line to install the bolts. But without the paperwork, no one on the assembly line knew that the door plug had ever been removed, or that its bolts were missing and needed to be replaced.\n\nTragedy narrowly averted\n\nThe fact that the door plug didn\u2019t come out when the plane was at 35,000 feet rather than at a lower altitude with passengers still buckled into their seats is the first part of the good luck.\n\nThe plane made 153 flights with passengers on it from the time it was delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and the January 5 flight, including 22 flights that took it over the Pacific Ocean for hours flying to and from Hawaii. It would have had much more difficulty making it safely to the ground if the door plug had failed hours, rather than minutes, from the nearest runway.\n\nAnd the fact that the two seats immediately adjacent to the door plug were two of the only seven empty seats on the plane carrying 177 people was very important in preventing fatalities. The force of the air inside the cabin rushing through the hole was enough to twist and bend the metal seats themselves towards the opening. Would-be passengers sitting in those unoccupied seats might not have been able to stay in the the plane, especially if they were not buckled in.\n\nBut perhaps most fortunate of all, when the door plug came out, it fell away from the plane without hitting the tail section, perhaps damaging the the rudder or the vertical stabilizers on the tail, which are crucial to the plane flying straight, level and under control. If that had happened, it would have been very difficult for the plane to land safely, if at all.\n\nBoeing\u2019s mounting problems\n\nEven after the hearing, it could be the better part of a year before a final report on the incident is released by the NTSB. But the probe is only one of the problems Boeing faces because of the incident.\n\nThere could be criminal charges related to the failures that led to the incident, as the FBI has notified passengers and crew members that they might be considered crime victims.\n\nEven before the flight, Boeing faced the possibility of criminal charges because of problems with the 737 Max that were kept hidden from the Federal Aviation Administration during the original certification process. Those problems led to a design flaw on the plane that is blamed for two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nIn January 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department agreed to a settlement that deferred criminal prosecution of Boeing for three years for its employees defrauding the FAA during the certification process. But that three-year probationary period had been due to end just days after the January 5 flight. Instead, the DOJ reopened the investigation following the Alaska Airlines incident, and last month Boeing agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and be put under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor.\n\nThe FAA has also increased scrutiny of Boeing\u2019s manufacturing process and is limiting how many planes it can build, which has added to financial losses at the company that have now reached $33 billion since the second fatal crash in 2019.\n\nBoeing\u2019s sales have plunged 70% in the first six months of the this year. In June it sold just three passenger jets, and one of those was to Alaska Airlines to replace the plane used in the January 5 flight, which Boeing has repurchased from the airline.\n\nLast days of current leadership\n\nBoeing will get a new boss the day after the hearing ends, as Dave Calhoun, who has served as CEO since January 2020, steps down and Kelly Ortberg, the former CEO of aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins, assumes the top job.\n\nCalhoun\u2019s departure is being termed a retirement, and he is 67. But when Boeing\u2019s board waived the retirement age for top executives for Calhoun in 2021 so he didn\u2019t have to retire after two years on the job, he said he intended to stay \u201cas long as they want me.\u201d He could have stayed in the job through 2027 under the waiver granted in 2021.\n\nHe has faced harsh criticism for many of Boeing\u2019s problems, with more than a dozen whistleblowers at the company complaining to congressional investigators that they faced pressure and retaliation for flagging safety problems in the company\u2019s assembly process.\n\nCalhoun has only testified on Capitol Hill once despite all the attention Boeing has received. In a stunning understatement he conceded the company\u2019s safety culture was \u201cfar from perfect,\u201d but vowed that safety is a priority and that the company is making progress. But that didn\u2019t stop a bipartisan grilling at a Senate hearing in June.\n\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you resigned?,\u201d he was asked by Senator Josh Hawley during that hearing.\n\n\u201cSenator, I\u2019m sticking this through,\u201d he replied. But his plans to leave the company by the end of the year had already been announced by the time of the hearing.",

        "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nUsha Vance, the wife of Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, defended her husband\u2019s previous comments deriding childless adults and downplayed his labeling of some Democratic politicians as \u201cchildless cat ladies,\u201d calling it a \u201cquip.\u201d\n\nIn a sit-down interview with Fox News that aired Monday, Usha Vance, a trial lawyer, argued her husband\u2019s past comments, which have received renewed scrutiny since he joined former President Donald Trump\u2019s presidential ticket, were in service of an argument about the challenges facing parents and the role government plays in parents\u2019 lives.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, JD made a quote \u2013 I mean, he made a quip, and he made a quip in service of making a point that he wanted to make that was substantive,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I just wish sometimes that people would talk about those things and that we would spend a lot less time just sort of going through this three-word phrase or that three-word phrase.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat he was really saying is that it can be really hard to be a parent in this country, and sometimes our policies are designed in a way that make it even harder,\u201d she continued.\n\nThe first solo interview from Usha Vance comes alongside fresh urgency for the Republican senator to quickly change the conversation around his candidacy. Trump allies have been eager to see Usha Vance defend her husband and the Republican ticket publicly as the campaign continues its defense of different resurfaced clips of JD Vance.\n\nHis past remarks have attracted ire from celebrity icons and Taylor Swift supporters but also from conservative outlets. The Wall Street Journal editorial board eviscerated Vance\u2019s comments as the \u201csort of smart-aleck crack that gets laughs in certain right-wing male precincts.\u201d Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro wondered out loud to his sizable audience if Trump was having doubts about his pick.\n\nIn her interview with Fox, Usha Vance said she believes her husband \u201cwould never\u201d intend to offend people who are struggling to have children while acknowledging that some people choose not to start families for \u201cvery good\u201d reasons.\n\n\u201cJD, absolutely at the time and today, would never, ever, ever want to say something to hurt someone who was trying to have a family, who really was struggling with that,\u201d she said. \u201cI also understand there are a lot of other reasons why people may choose not to have families, and many of those reasons are very good.\u201d\n\nUsha Vance insisted that her husband, who repeatedly made disparaging comments about childless adults in interviews, campaign appearances and fundraising emails while targeting Democratic officials, was attempting to have \u201ca real conversation\u201d about how government can help parents raise their children.\n\nA CNN KFile review of multiple similar remarks from JD Vance underscores how the \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d comment was part of a broader pattern of him pressing the culture war by, in part, singling out Democratic leaders for not having children.\n\nIn November 2020, for example, JD Vance said on a conservative podcast that childless Americans, especially those in the country\u2019s \u201cleadership class,\u201d were \u201cmore sociopathic\u201d than those with children and made the country \u201cless mentally stable.\u201d Vance added that the \u201cmost deranged\u201d and \u201cmost psychotic\u201d commentators on Twitter \u2013 now known as X - were typically childless.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try to look at the real conversation that he\u2019s trying to have,\u201d Usha Vance said, \u201cand engage with it and understand for those of us who do have families, for the many of us who want to have families, and for whom it\u2019s really hard, what can we do to make it better.\u201d\n\nVance says she\u2019s come to \u2018understand\u2019 Trump\n\nUsha Vance also pushed back on reports that both she and her husband privately condemned Trump before JD Vance joined Trump on the Republican ticket.\n\nIn the interview, Vance appeared to confirm a Washington Post report detailing her outrage towards Trump in the wake of the January 6, 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol, but said that she has grown to \u201cunderstand\u201d Trump since then.\n\n\u201cWell, you know, I\u2019ve had several years since then to kind of understand what it is that he is out to do,\u201d Vance said of Trump. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t feel that the ticket, you know, the Trump-Vance ticket was able to do some real good for the country, then I wouldn\u2019t be here supporting him and JD wouldn\u2019t have done this.\u201d\n\nVance said that her and her husband sometimes disagree about political issues, acknowledging \u201cwe\u2019re two different people,\u201d but said she believes in the \u201cintention\u201d behind his political career.\n\n\u201cWe have lots of different backgrounds and interests and things like that. So we come to different conclusions all the time. But that\u2019s part of the fun of being married,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I never doubt about JD, even when I disagree about this or that, is his intention, what it is that he really wants to do.\u201d\n\nVance also defended her husband\u2019s private exchanges with a law school friend published in a New York Times article in which he disparaged Trump and said \u201cI hate the police.\u201d Vance denied her husband hates the police and said her husband\u2019s friend sharing their personal correspondence publicly was \u201churtful.\u201d\n\n\u201cJD certainly does not hate the police. I think that is clear through his career, and before,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe he had a negative interaction once or twice and made a, you know, remark like that. I don\u2019t know. But since then, and always as long as I\u2019ve known him, he\u2019s had a great deal of respect for them and everything they do to keep us safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve both been in a position of having people speculate about us a lot and make \u2013 draw a lot of conclusions based on sometimes information that isn\u2019t even true,\u201d she said of the New York Times report. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to do the same about other people.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

        "text": "Dhaka, Bangladesh CNN \u2014\n\nThe prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, resigned on Monday after weeks of deadly anti-government demonstrations gripped the South Asian nation.\n\nThe announcement from Bangladesh\u2019s army chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman, came after protesters stormed the official residence of the prime minister in the capital, Dhaka.\n\nImages showed flames billowing from vehicles near Hasina\u2019s house, with police unable to contain throngs of people charging toward the neighborhood. Scenes also emerged of people clambering atop an imposing statue of Hasina\u2019s father, independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in Dhaka, and carving away at the head with an axe, according to Reuters.\n\nEarlier in the day, the military and police had attacked demonstrators rallying in the area, according to a journalist working for CNN in Dhaka.\n\nAt least 91 people were killed and hundreds injured on Sunday in clashes between police and protesters demanding the scrapping of quotas for government jobs and the resignation of the prime minister. Opponents say the civil service job quotas are discriminatory.\n\nThe death toll on Sunday, which included 13 police officers, was the highest for a single day from any protests in the country\u2019s recent history. The figure surpassed the 67 deaths reported on July 19, when students took to the streets against the quotas, Reuters reported. At least 32 children were killed during protests last month, UNICEF said on Friday.\n\nThe widespread unrest \u2013 which spilled into the cities of Rajshahi, Barisal and Chittagong among others \u2013 prompted the government to impose an indefinite nationwide curfew over the weekend. Meanwhile, human rights groups accused authorities of using excessive force against protesters, a charge the government denies.\n\nThe military will form an interim government in the wake of Hasina\u2019s resignation, according to the army chief, who called on students \u201cto maintain peace and help us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever demands you have, we will fulfil and bring back peace to the nation, please help us in this, stay away from violence,\u201d Zaman said on Monday. He added that \u201cthe military will not fire at anyone, the police will not fire at anyone, I have given orders.\u201d\n\nThe US embassy in Dhaka urged US citizens to \u201cshelter in a safe place,\u201d in new travel guidance issued Monday. Authorities added that US nationals in the capital should consider returning to their home country, amid the \u201cunpredictable and volatile\u201d atmosphere.\n\nThe main flight hub in Dhaka, the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, was temporarily closed following Hasina\u2019s resignation, according to the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) state news agency.\n\nJust on Sunday, Hasina had accused student protesters of being \u201cterrorists,\u201d attempting to \u201cdestabilize the nation,\u201d Reuters reported. \u201cI appeal to our countrymen to suppress these terrorists with a strong hand,\u201d she said.\n\nEarlier this year human rights organizations expressed concern over increased reports of political violence, following a general election that saw Hasina secure a fourth consecutive term in office.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party boycotted the national vote in January, as critics warned Hasina and her government were headed toward a one-party system marred by accusations of authoritarianism.\n\nPeople reacted with a mixture of jubilation and cynicism following her resignation on Monday.\n\n\u201cHasina may be gone, but there is still a long road ahead for Bangladesh \u2013 until our religious minorities and ethnic minorities are protected and justice comes to them too, the nation is not free,\u201d Khatib Zahin, 28, told CNN.\n\nAnother resident, Arifeen Mahmood Khan, said: \u201cLet\u2019s be better, stronger and kinder than we\u2019ve ever been before. Let\u2019s work together to build a better Bangladesh we\u2019ve always dreamed of.\u201d\n\nPolice \u2018brutally beating\u2019 protesters\n\nPolice opened fire on protesters in Dhaka earlier in the day, according to a journalist working for CNN, even as security forces have been under scrutiny for unleashing a wave of brutality on demonstrators.\n\nAt least four people sustained injuries as protesters were gathering at Dhaka Medical College on Monday, according to the journalist. One of those people was shot in the head.\n\nProtesters told CNN that \u2060the military was blocking Dhaka Medical College Bakshibazar Gate. Police also used tear gas on protesters there, according to a demonstrator on the ground.\n\nMen run past a shopping center which was set on fire by protesters, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on August 4. Rajib Dhar/AP\n\nStudents and protesters at Dhaka University Campus and the Shaheed Minar, a national monument in the capital, were beaten by police as they assembled at these locations.\n\nProtesters there said that the police had attempted to break up the crowd by \u201cbrutally beating\u201d them with bamboo sticks and using tear gas.\n\n\u201cDirect open firing took place in Shahbag area 15 minutes ago. We don\u2019t have an estimate of how many were injured. It is still ongoing. Near Motijhil Shantinagar, tear gas has been fired on common people,\u201d one demonstrator told CNN.\n\nSheikh Hasina is seen on November 11, 2021. Protesters celebrated her resignation on Monday, as nationwide rallies over quotas for government jobs sweep the country. Christophe Ena/AP\n\nIn other locations across Dhaka, the military has also fired warning shots in the sky and towards protesters.\n\nDetails and videos are scant as Bangladesh is in the midst of a \u201cnear-total national internet shutdown after earlier social media and mobile cuts\u201d according to data from Netblocks, a global internet monitor.\n\nVideo posted on social media and verified by CNN showed security forces launching live rounds into the air near protesters on the N1 highway in Dhaka.\n\nProtesters in Dhaka told CNN that the university campus had been surrounded by armed forces.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to reflect the fact that at least 91 people were killed in clashes on Sunday.",

        "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nMichigan\u2019s Alma Cooper, a US Army officer, was named Miss USA on Sunday, becoming the third person to hold the title this year following the shock resignation of 2023\u2019s winner.\n\nThe 22-year-old, who has a Master\u2019s in data science from Stanford University, beat 50 other contestants in a pageant that included swimwear and evening gown competitions. Kentucky\u2019s Connor Perry and Oklahoma\u2019s Danika Christopherson were named first and second runners up, respectively. Cooper is a second lieutenant who serves as a military intelligence officer, according to her social media.\n\n\u201cAs the daughter of a migrant worker, a proud Afro Latina woman and an officer of the United States Army, I am living the American dream,\u201d she had told judges during a Q&A session at Sunday\u2019s finale. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything that my life and my mother have taught me, it\u2019s that your circumstances never define your destiny: You can make success accessible through demanding excellence.\u201d\n\nCooper was crowned on stage by previous titleholder, Savannah Gankiewicz of Hawaii, who inherited the tiara in May after Utah\u2019s Noelia Voigt stepped down in highly controversial circumstances.\n\nThe glitzy televised event capped three months of turbulence for pageant organizers sparked by Voigt\u2019s surprise resignation \u2014 and that of then-reigning Miss Teen USA, New Jersey\u2019s UmaSofia Srivastava, just days later. The show featured no explicit references to the controversy, though Gankiewicz described her unexpected three-month stint as Miss USA as \u201cthe most unique reign in history.\u201d\n\nAlma Cooper onstage with former Miss USA titleholder Savannah Gankiewicz of Hawaii. Gilbert Flores/Variety//Getty Images\n\nAnnouncing her decision via Instagram in May, Voigt attributed her resignation to mental health reasons. But social media users quickly spotted that the first letter of the first 11 sentences of her cryptic post spelled \u201cI am silenced,\u201d sparking rumors of a strict non-disclosure agreement.\n\nHer resignation letter, later obtained by CNN, alleged delays in receiving prizes and a \u201ctoxic work environment\u201d that \u201cat best, is poor management and, at worst, is bullying and harassment.\u201d Voigt also claimed to have been sexually harassed during a public appearance due the Miss USA organization\u2019s failure to provide an \u201ceffective handler.\u201d\n\nSrivastava, who won the Miss Teen USA competition (a companion event, under the same ownership, for contestants aged 14 to 19), meanwhile attributed her resignation to a clash in \u201cpersonal values\u201d with the Miss USA organization. Both women\u2019s mothers then appeared on Good Morning America, with Srivastava\u2019s mother, Barbara, saying the beauty queens had been \u201cill-treated, abused, bullied and cornered,\u201d and that \u201cthe job of their dreams turned out to be a nightmare.\u201d\n\nOrganizers and the pageants\u2019 parent company, the Miss Universe Organization, did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment at the time of the double resignation. Miss USA president Laylah Rose released a statement at the end of May, reported by the Los Angeles Times, refuting Voigt\u2019s allegations.\n\nNew rules, groundbreaking firsts\n\nThe evening\u2019s proceedings began with an elimination, as the 51 contestants were narrowed down to a top 20 based on judges\u2019 scores from Saturday\u2019s preliminary competition. The results of a swimwear competition saw the field reduced to 10 ahead of an eveningwear parade.\n\nThe final five were then asked the same question: \u201cHow can we bridge the gap between different cultures and foster understanding and respect?\u201d\n\nContestants on stage at the Miss USA finale in Los Angeles, California. Chelsea Lauren/Shutterstock\n\nThe televised finale, which was hosted by Garcelle Beauvais from \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d and E!

        "text": "Hong Kong/London CNN \u2014\n\nJapanese stocks on Monday suffered their biggest daily loss since 1987 as fears about a US economic slowdown sent shock waves through global markets.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 index of leading stocks in Tokyo lost a staggering 4,451 points, its biggest point drop in history. On the more common, percentage measure, the index closed more than 12% down \u2014 according to Reuters, its largest one-day fall since October 1987. The drop took Nikkei\u2019s losses since early July to 25%, pushing it into bear market territory.\n\n\u201cThat was a crash. It smelled like 1987,\u201d Neil Newman, head of strategy at Astris Advisory in Tokyo, told CNN. He was referring to \u201cBlack Monday\u201d in October 1987, when global markets plunged and the Nikkei lost 3,836 points.\n\nFears of a sharp slowdown in the US economy have raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will have to slash interest rates. Coming as the Bank of Japan takes its interest rates higher to contain inflation, that is boosting the value of the yen against the US dollar and making Japanese export-dependent stocks less attractive.\n\nAt the same time, tech stocks are being hammered by a combination of mixed earnings and increasing skepticism among some investors about the hype around artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cThe buzz is all about the contagion effect of this aggressive bear onslaught, underscored by fears of a hard landing in the US and a severe meltdown in Tokyo\u2019s markets, which now appear to be self-perpetuating,\u201d said Stephen Innes, managing partner of SPI Asset Management.\n\nTrading was halted for short periods of time in Japan and South Korea as circuit breakers designed to prevent panic selling were triggered multiple times.\n\n\u201c(Today) was relentless,\u201d said Newman. \u201cIt was unusual because there was the absence of a rebound at the end of the day, which you would normally see due to short covering,\u201d he added. That\u2019s when traders buy back shares they have borrowed to sell.\n\nThe volatility spread to other markets in Asia and Europe, and US stock futures fell sharply overnight. Nasdaq futures were down 4%. Dow futures and S&P 500 futures were down 1.5% and 2.3% respectively.\n\nGlobal rout\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 index, the region\u2019s benchmark, was 2.5% down in morning trade. It has fallen 6% in the past five days to lows last seen in February.\n\nMohit Kumar, an economist at Jefferies, said a big driver of recent market moves was previous enthusiastic buying. \u201cUS equities, particularly the tech sector, (were) overowned and some froth needed to be cleared,\u201d he wrote in a note Monday.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Taiex ended down 8.4%, its worst day ever, while South Korea\u2019s Kospi finished 8.8% lower. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 lost 3.7%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index and China\u2019s Shanghai Composite were down 2.3% and 1.3% respectively.\n\nThe volatility in Japan started last week, when the BOJ raised interest rates for the second time this year and announced plans to taper its bond buying. Traders expect more rate hikes to come later this year as the central bank tries to contain inflation.\n\nThe Nikkei closed down 5.8% Friday, as traders fretted about the impact of a stronger yen on Japanese companies. A rising yen would hurt exporters and companies with overseas earnings.\n\nA rapid appreciation in the Japanese currency has also forced many market participants to unwind the yen carry trade, a hugely popular trading strategy. With interest rates having been extremely low in Japan for decades, many investors have borrowed cash cheaply there before converting it to other currencies to invest in higher-yielding assets.\n\nLast week, the yen surged nearly 5% against the greenback. On Monday, it strengthened further, up 2.2% to trade at 143.3 per US dollar.\n\nInnes said the \u201cbeefier\u201d yen triggered a global unwinding of carry trades.\n\nFrom there, the market turmoil morphed into a \u201cfull-on avalanche,\u201d propelled by the surprisingly hawkish turn from the BOJ, China\u2019s economy slowing to a crawl and weak US tech earnings, he added.\n\nSlew of factors\n\nChina reported last Wednesday that its official manufacturing PMI fell in July, signaling continued weakness in factory activity.\n\nIn the United States, Amazon (AMZN) reported Thursday an earnings miss for the second quarter and disappointing guidance for the third quarter. Intel (INTC), on the same day, reported an income loss of $1.6 billion in the second quarter and announced plans to slash 15% of its workforce to reduce costs.\n\nUS stocks had already ended Friday lower, as disappointing jobs data added to fears that the US economy is weakening. The Dow closed 1.5% lower, the S&P 500 lost 1.8% and the Nasdaq Composite declined 2.4%. The Nasdaq closed in correction territory, or more than 10% off its most recent high on July 10.\n\nCNN\u2019s Fear and Greed index, which measures market sentiment, has fallen to a \u201cfear\u201d reading of 27.\n\nOther markets are also showing jitters. On Friday, oil prices settled at their lowest levels since January. Brent crude futures and US WTI crude were both down more than 3%.\n\nCurrently hovering around eight-month lows, oil prices may see some stability for the time being, despite threats of a wider conflict in the Middle East, according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service.\n\n\u201cBeginning with the Hamas action last October 7, we are seeing mostly apathy when it comes to fears about a wider regional war in the Middle East,\u201d he said.\n\nCrypto currencies haven\u2019t been immune, either. Bitcoin was down more than 12% at just under $53,000, according to Coindesk.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

Trent is the best passer in the world, but a fallible defender. The obvious change is to play Trent in midfield.\n\nMartin: Trent is so good that he can play anywhere, so I think Bradley at right-back and Trent in a free role to make the most of his unbeatable passing ability.\n\nTrevor: The new manager must go with introducing quality youth into the team, especially after the stellar break-through season Conor Bradley had as an attacking right-back. I believe that is where he should permanently stay.\n\nSqueaks: It is a difficult one. Bradley is an exceptional talent, who is equally as good as Trent in the right-back role. He has ably demonstrated that in Trent's absence. But, if he was to take the regular spot, where would Trent play? Selling Trent is unthinkable and I cannot see that happening. I would tie Trent down to new contract and see how the season pans out.\n\nRoss: I think we already know that Alexander-Arnold is deficient defensively, but unable to manage in the midfield wholly. It means being supportive of him in a different way. He has to play as he's too talented not to, but I think it means doing things a bit differently.

[ Return to card summary ]\n\nHow to choose a credit card based on its intro bonus\n\nA credit card's welcome bonus is often the most valuable benefit. However, it's only a one-time perk, so you'll want to carefully consider everything else the card offers before applying. As you're analyzing intro bonus offers, it's important to pay attention to two factors: Bonus value and requirements. Bonus value For certain types of cards, it's simple to estimate the bonus value. For example, a cash bonus of $500 is worth $500, but how much are 50,000 points or miles worth? The answer depends on the type of rewards and how you intend to use them. If you want to earn hotel points or airline miles, you can only redeem those points within that program, which limits your options. However, when you earn transferrable points, you typically can move those rewards to many different airlines or hotels. This added flexibility can increase the value of flexible rewards, so 50,000 transferrable points are generally worth more than 50,000 hotel points. Bonus requirements If you're approved for a card, you'll still need to meet the spending requirement before you're awarded any bonus points, miles or cash. To ensure you can hit the spending threshold without overspending, look at your credit card statement for the past few months or the year. This should give you a good idea of how much you can expect to spend on your new card. If you usually spend $1,500 on your credit card(s) each month, then any card with a spending requirement of $4,500 or less within three months should be achievable for you. You can also plan your credit card application around bigger, but less frequent expenses. If you're paying your annual insurance premiums or booking lodging for your yearly vacation, it might make sense to apply for a card beforehand.\n\nCredit card welcome bonus pros and cons\n\nCard credit intro bonuses can help you collect loads of miles, points or other rewards. However, these are one-time bonuses, and you need to look at a card's benefits and perks to get the full picture of whether it's a worthy addition to your wallet. Welcome bonuses also typically have spending requirements that need to be met within a certain timeframe and these requirements aren't always easy to meet. Pros Welcome bonuses can be exceptionally valuable, even when you factor in the spending requirement. The best offers may provide 10X to 20X points per dollar on the spending you need to make to earn the bonus.\n\nIntro bonuses allow you to quickly earn enough rewards to book more valuable redemptions, such as business-class flights or luxury hotels that typically have higher point or mile requirements. Cons A card's welcome bonus could entice you to spend more than you otherwise would have. In this scenario, you may end up paying interest if you can't afford to pay off the balance.\n\nIntro bonuses are one-off card benefits, so you need to make sure the card's ongoing perks are worth it or offset the annual fee (if there is one).\n\nFAQs What is a credit card sign-up bonus? A credit card sign-up bonus is an incentive to entice consumers to open a new credit card and make purchases with the card. You typically need to spend a certain amount within a specified period of time to earn the bonus. How do credit card sign-up bonuses work? Credit card sign-up bonuses are typically one-time offers you can qualify for when you open a new card. These rewards often come in the form of cashback, points or miles, and generally require spending a certain amount of money with that card within the first few months of account opening. The spending thresholds vary but generally range from $500 to $5,000. Are credit card sign-up bonus offers worth it? Credit card sign-up bonuses can be worth it as they can add hundreds of dollars (or sometimes even over a thousand dollars) back to your wallet and are generally non-taxable since you had to spend money to earn them. However, you should only pursue a welcome bonus if you can meet the spending requirement without overspending or stretching yourself too thin. You don't want to carry a balance just to earn a bonus since the interest charges could outweigh the value of any rewards you earn. How many credit card sign-up bonuses can you earn? Some card issuers like American Express limit the number of sign-up bonuses you can earn for a card to once per lifetime, while others may allow you to earn a sign-up bonus multiple times, but may make you wait a certain period of time before being eligible again. What sign-up bonuses are the easiest to get? Cashback cards like the Wells Fargo Active Cash Card and the Capital One SavorOne Cash Rewards Credit Card generally have sign-up bonuses that are easier to earn. What is the best credit card sign-up bonus? While the best credit card sign-up bonus will depend on the individual, travel rewards cards like the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card, Chase Sapphire Preferred Card and The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express currently offer some of the largest welcome bonuses.\n\nSubscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!

See our methodology for more information on how we choose the best credit card sign-up bonuses.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo determine which cards offer the best value, CNBC Select analyzed over 250 major credit cards issued through FDIC-insured banks and NCUA-insured credit unions that are widely available in the U.S. and offer welcome bonuses. We compared each card on a range of features, including rewards (e.g., cash back, points and miles), annual fees, welcome bonuses, introductory and standard APR and balance transfer fees and foreign transaction fees. We also considered additional perks (e.g., ongoing travel or merchant statement credits), cardholder protections (e.g., purchase protection, $0 liability protection and travel insurance), the application process when available (e.g., is there a credit pull or required credit score) and how easy it is to redeem points (e.g., are rewards are tied to a specific brand; if transferable, to how many/which partners, can you redeem for straight cash back).\n\n\n\nWe also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools. For the cards that offered a rewards program, we considered consumer spending data forecasts from location intelligence firm Esri to determine where U.S. consumers are spending the most money, like on dining and travel. We used this to help determine what bonus categories are most useful for consumers. Since the value of a point or mile varies based on what they can be redeemed for, we also considered things like transferability and the ability to redeem for cash-back.

Know what cards you're eligible for Your credit score goes a long way in determining what cards you can qualify for. If you're looking to boost your credit score from average to excellent to increase your approval odds for a home loan, an unsecured credit card could work for you. Credit cards for average credit may also have rewards and other benefits for you to take advantage of. If you're new to credit or recovering from bankruptcy, you may need to start with a secured credit card. Some credit cards offer pre-approval or pre-qualification, which doesn't guarantee you'll be approved for a card, but it can save you from applying for a card you're likely to be rejected for. In some situations, it may make sense to apply for a card issued by the bank where you have checking or savings accounts because that could boost your approval odds. Understand what matters when building credit By making on-time payments, credit cards allow you to slowly rebuild your credit score or fill out your personal credit report. When you keep your credit card balance low, or ideally, pay it off fully each month, this also helps boost your credit score. So building good financial habits is more important than finding the most rewarding credit card. When you want to use a credit card to establish your credit history, think of rewards as icing on the cake. Don't look for lucrative welcome bonuses or overspending to earn rewards on unlock benefits.\n\nHow to build credit with a credit card\n\nThere are different types of credit scoring models, such as FICO Score and VantageScore, but the most popular scores use the information found on your credit report. They typically use the information available from the three major credit reporting bureaus: Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. By opening a credit card, you're adding to your credit profile. However, how you use the credit card is what matters the most. Pay your monthly bill on time Your payment history is a huge part of your credit score. So it's important to pay your credit card bill on time and consistently. As these payments are documented in your credit report, your credit score is more likely to improve over time. Keep your balance low Your total debt also factors heavily into how your credit score is calculated. Having less debt and using a smaller percentage of your available credit (keeping a low credit utilization ratio) will have a positive impact on your credit score. This makes having a budget in place an important part of building credit. It can be easy to overspend with a credit card and if you find yourself in this situation, it could hurt your credit instead of help it.\n\nTypes of cards to look for if you want to build credit\n\nRewards and travel benefits shouldn't be the priority when building credit. Rather, you should use a credit-building card to establish responsible credit habits. Once you're in a situation where you can consistently pay off your credit cards in full and on time, then you're ready to consider credit cards with larger welcome bonuses and useful benefits. Secured credit cards Secured credit cards require an upfront deposit and your credit limit is based on that deposit. Secured credit cards like the Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card are less risky for card issuers and you can possibly qualify for secured cards with no credit history or if you have a weak credit score. Unsecured credit cards do not require a security deposit and have a credit limit based on your income, credit history and other factors. There are unsecured credit cards available to those with average or fair credit, but in general, if you have no credit or bad credit, an unsecured credit card will be your best option for moving your credit score forward. Student credit cards If you're interested in opening your first credit card, are over 18 years old and are enrolled in an eligible college, consider a student credit card like the Discover it\u00ae Student Cash Back. These cards are designed with students in mind and are often available even if you don't have a credit history. Many of these cards also don't require a security deposit and some even offer rewards.\n\nWhat does it mean to build your credit?\n\nYour credit score is based on the information in your credit report. To build your credit you need activity, like credit card and loan payments, to be reported to credit bureaus. Your credit score is generally based on factors such as payment history, the age of your accounts and total debt. When you open a credit card and pay the balance on time consistently, this improves your credit score and is a signal to creditors that you're a reliable borrower. However, having a credit card can work both ways. If you miss payments or are late paying, that harms your credit score. Also, if you pay on time, but accumulate debt that can hurt your credit score. Overall, the best way to build credit is to have a long history of positive activity (i.e. paying on time) with creditors such as banks and credit unions.\n\nTips for building credit\n\nThere's no set formula for building credit. Instead, your habits, over time, will move your credit score in one direction or another. However, there are a few tips that can help you get things headed in the right direction. Understand how credit scores work Knowing what goes into your credit score is key to building a healthy credit profile. While there are multiple types of credit scores, the most popular credit scoring models are largely based on factors such as: Payment history\n\nDebt\n\nTypes of credit\n\nAge of accounts Each of these factors are weighted differently, and your payment history and debt typically are more important. It's important to develop the habit of paying bills on time and creating a plan to stay out of debt or pay down your existing debt if you want to improve your credit score. Get added as an authorized user If your lack of credit history is preventing you from getting approved for a credit card or a car loan, it might make sense to get added as an authorized user on someone else's account. When you're added as an authorized user, the credit history of that account could be added to your credit report. This can be a double-edged sword, so it only makes sense to go this route with someone with a history of paying their credit cards on time and in full. Monitor your credit A credit monitoring service can help you maintain an error-free credit report by alerting you when anything changes on your credit report. There are free credit monitoring services that are useful, but if you want to cover all the credit bureaus you may want to opt for a more robust paid service. PrivacyGuard, named one of CNBC Select's best credit monitoring services, provides the ability to monitor all three major credit bureaus and offers identity protection.\n\nPrivacyGuard\u00ae Learn More Cost $9.99 to $24.99 per month\n\nCredit bureaus monitored Experian, Equifax and TransUnion\n\nCredit scoring model used VantageScore\n\nDark web scan Yes, for Identity and Total Protection plans\n\nIdentity insurance Yes, up to $1 million for Identity and Total Protection plans Terms apply.\n\nUse credit-building tools Some services can help your credit score by allowing you to include additional information on your credit report.

Building a good credit score is necessary for many major financial moves, including taking out a mortgage, opening a credit card, getting car insurance and sometimes even landing your dream job. If you don't have a good or excellent credit score, you may not get approved for a certain financial product or may pay higher interest rates. What are the benefits of building credit? Building credit has many benefits because nearly every facet of your financial life is impacted by the strength of your credit score. Building a good credit score helps improve your approval odds for financial products, helps you qualify for lower interest rates and better terms and allows you to to benefit from robust credit card benefits. Can I get approved for a credit card with no credit history? It is possible to sign up for a credit card without having a credit history. It's generally easier to get approved for secured credit cards or starter credit cards, which are designed especially for those who are beginning to build their credit. How do I improve my credit score? The best way to improve your credit score is by consistently practicing responsible credit behavior, such as paying your bills on time every month and limiting your credit utilization ratio. Do authorized users build credit? Becoming an authorized user on someone else's credit card is a great way to build credit. So long as the primary cardholder has good (670 to 799) or excellent credit (800 to 850), it can be relatively low-risk and allows you to build or boost your credit score. However, there are also instances where being an authorized user can harm your credit score, such as if the primary account holder misses a payment.\n\nWhy trust CNBC Select?\n\nAt CNBC Select, our mission is to provide our readers with high-quality service journalism and comprehensive consumer advice so they can make informed decisions with their money.

We also considered additional perks (e.g., ongoing travel or merchant statement credits), cardholder protections (e.g., purchase protection, $0 liability protection and travel insurance), the application process when available (e.g., is there a credit pull or required credit score) and how easy it is to redeem points (e.g., are rewards are tied to a specific brand; if transferable, to how many/which partners, can you redeem for straight cash back).\n\n\n\nWe also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools. For the cards that offered a rewards program, we considered consumer spending data forecasts from location intelligence firm Esri to determine where U.S. consumers are spending the most money, like on dining and travel. We used this to help determine what bonus categories are most useful for consumers. Since the value of a point or mile varies based on what they can be redeemed for, we also considered things like transferability and the ability to redeem for cash-back. When choosing the best credit cards for rebuilding credit, we focused on cards that are available to consumers with lower credit scores or those with no credit history. While rewards and other benefits were also factored into our decisions, these were secondary considerations.

Simply put, you take out a new loan to pay off old debt, then pay back the new debt according to agreed-upon terms. It makes sense to refinance if you can't afford your current bill payments and need to find a lower monthly plan, or if your credit score is good enough to qualify you for a lower APR, which makes paying off the debt cheaper. For example, say you have a $10,000 balance on your credit card that charges interest at a rate of 24.99% APR. Assuming you can afford to make $400 monthly payments, it would take about three years to pay your balance off entirely. You'll also pay about $4,000 in interest, according to Experian's debt payoff calculator. On the other hand, transferring that debt to a personal loan with a 9% APR, can save you more than $3,000. Experian's calculator estimates with the same monthly payment ($400) and the lower APR, you can pay off the balance in 22 months and only pay $875 in interest charges overall. When you apply for a personal loan, you should consider the APR and the loan's term, or the length of time it will take you to pay it off. Make sure the monthly loan repayment amount fits into your budget, so you're able to comfortably pay off the loan and get your debt under control.\n\nCan debt refinancing hurt your credit score?\n\nAt its best, debt refinancing can boost your credit score by making your monthly payments more affordable and motivating you to pay off your balances. But they aren't entirely risk-free. Personal loan applications require a credit check, so you'll want to make sure you know your credit score before you apply. There's no direct penalty for getting denied a loan, but having too many applications on your credit record could be a red flag to future lenders. For debt refinancing to work, you have to \"plan your work and work your plan,\" so to speak. It helps to be honest about your money habits and the overall state of your personal finances before taking on any loan. Personal loans deliver cash directly to your bank account, making it easy to stay in debt if you're not careful. If you have concerns, opt for a loan that pays your creditors directly so that there's no opportunity for you to overspend. And before you agree to a new loan, make sure you have room in your budget to pay it back on time and in full according to the terms. A late payment on your personal loan can hurt your credit score just like if you miss a credit card bill.\n\nWhat is a good interest rate on a personal loan?\n\nMost personal loans come with fixed-rate APRs, so your monthly payment stays the same for the loan's lifetime. In a few cases, you can take out a variable-rate personal loan. If you go that route, make sure you're comfortable with your monthly payments changing if rates go up or down. Personal loan APRs average 9.65%, according to the Fed's most recent data. Meanwhile, the average credit card interest rate is around 16.28%. When considering whether to invest or pay off debt, consider that the average rate of return in the stock market tends to be above 5% when adjusted for inflation. So if you can find a personal loan with interest rates would be below 5%, you can slowly pay off your debt while also investing because you know your investments could still earn more than you're paying in interest. However, it's not always easy to qualify for personal loans with interest rates lower than 5% APR. Your interest rate will be decided based on your credit score, credit history and income, as well as other factors like the loan's size and term. See if you're pre-approved for a personal loan offer.\n\nHow do personal loans work?\n\nOnce you're approved for a personal loan, the cash is usually delivered directly to your checking account. However, if you opt for a debt consolidation/refinancing loan, you can sometimes have your lender pay your credit card accounts directly. Any extra cash leftover will be deposited into your bank account or returned to the lender. Most loan terms range anywhere from six months to seven years. The longer the term, the lower your monthly payments will be, but they usually also have higher interest rates. It's best to elect for the shortest term you can afford. When deciding on a loan term, consider how much you will end up paying in interest overall. Your monthly loan bill will include your installment payment plus interest charges. If you think you may want to pay off the loan earlier than planned, be sure to check if the lender charges an early payoff or prepayment penalty. Sometimes lenders charge a fee if you make extra payments to pay your debt down quicker, since they are losing out on that prospective interest. The fee could be a flat rate, a percentage of your loan amount or the rest of the interest you would have owed them. Once you receive the money from your loan, you have to pay back the lender in monthly installments, usually starting within 30 days. When your personal loan is paid off, the credit line is closed and you no longer have access to it.\n\nHow is my personal loan rate decided?\n\nAs you shop for a low-interest loan or credit card, remember that banks are looking for reliable borrowers who make timely payments. Financial institutions will look at your credit score, income, payment history and, in some cases, cash reserves when deciding what APR to give you. To get approved for any kind of credit product (credit card, loan, mortgage, etc.), you'll first submit an application and agree to let the lender pull your credit report. This helps lenders understand how much debt you owe, what your current monthly payments are and how much additional debt you have the capacity to take on. Once you submit your application, you may be approved for a variety of loan options. Each will have a different length of time to pay the loan back (your term) and a different interest rate. Your interest rate will be decided based on your credit score, credit history and income, as well as other factors like the loan's size and term. Generally, loans with longer terms have higher interest rates than loans you bay back over a shorter period of time.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo determine which personal loans are the best for refinancing debt, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions. When possible we chose loans with no origination or sign-up fees, but we also included options for borrowers with lower credit scores on this list. Some of those options have origination fees. When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n\nVariable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan.

Creditor payment limits and loan sizes: The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $1,000 to $100,000. Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. Note that the rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more. *Your LightStream loan terms, including APR, may differ based on loan purpose, amount, term length, and your credit profile.

This lender provides personal loans for just about every purpose except for higher education and small businesses. Another pro to using this lender is that LightStream doesn't charge any origination, administration or early payoff fees. Eligible borrowers Good to excellent credit needed Loan amounts $5,000 to $100,000 Loan terms 24 to 144 months [ Return to account summary ]\n\nSoFi\n\nSoFi Personal Loans are available from $5,000 to as much as $100,000, which makes them a great option for those who need more money to cover bigger expenses. Plus, SoFi personal loans do not require origination fees. SoFi offers a 0.25% interest rate reduction for signing up for autopay. There's also some more flexibility when it comes to choosing the type of interest rate you receive. Loan applicants can choose between variable and fixed APR. Fixed APRs give you one rate that you pay for the entirety of your loan, and variable interest rates fluctuate, but SoFi caps them at 29.99%. Eligible borrowers Must reside in a state where SoFi is authorized to lend and must be employed, have sufficient income from other sources, or have an offer of employment to start within the next 90 days. Loan amounts $5,000 to $100,000 Loan terms 24 to 84 months [ Return to account summary ]\n\nPenFed\n\nPenFed is a federal credit union that provides many personal loan options for debt consolidation, home improvement, medical expenses, auto financing and more. You don't need to be a member to apply, but you will need to sign up for a PenFed membership and keep $5 in a qualifying savings account to receive your funds. It offers personal loans as small as $600 which makes it a great option for those who don't need higher amounts of financing. Eligible borrowers While it's not required to be a PenFed member to apply, a membership will be created for you if you decide to accept the loan. Loan amounts $600 to $50,000 Loan terms 1 to 5 years [ Return to account summary ]\n\nAvant\n\nAvant stands out for considering applicants with credit scores under 600, but keep in mind that the higher your credit score, the more likely you are to receive the lowest rates. Before you decide to apply for this loan, you can see if you pre-qualify for a rate that's on the lower end of the APR range. While there are no penalties for early payoff, there is an origination fee of up to 4.75% and a late fee of up to $25 after the 10-day grace period. Eligible borrowers Applicants must have a personal checking or savings account on file Loan amounts $2,000 to $35,000 Loan terms 24 to 60 months [ Return to account summary ]\n\nOneMain Financial\n\nOneMain Financial offers personal loan options that are a little more flexible compared to other lenders. Repayment terms run between 24 months and 60 months and OneMain Financial also allows borrowers the option to secure the loan with collateral to potentially receive an interest rate on the lower end of the lender's range. Plus, borrowers can choose the date their monthly payments are due and have the option to apply with a co-applicant. OneMain Financial has an origination fee that's on the higher end: either a fixed fee between $25 and $500 or up to 10% of the loan amount, depending on which state you live in. While there aren't any penalties for paying off the loan early, there is a late fee that will run you $30 or up to 15% (depending on your state). Eligible borrowers Applicants must submit proof of income and proof of residence to be considered Loan amounts $1,500 to $20,000 Loan terms 24, 36, 48, 60 Months [ Return to account summary ]\n\nProsper\n\nProsper allows co-borrowers to submit a joint personal loan application, which can be beneficial if the primary borrower has a limited credit history or has a lower credit score. The co-borrower on a personal loan application shares the liability for repaying the loan with the primary borrower which is why lenders may see a borrower as less risky if they have another person applying alongside them. Origination fees are between 2.41% to 5% and get deducted from the loan proceeds. Eligible borrowers Must reside in a state where Prosper is authorized to lend and be at least 18 years of age Loan amounts $2,000 to $50,000 Loan terms 24, 36, 48, and 60 months [ Return to account summary ]\n\nCiti Bank\n\nCiti is a household name in the banking and lending space. In addition to having in-person branches nationwide, this lender also offers ways for customers to use its services online. Citi stands out as a personal loan lender because it doesn't charge origination fees, early payoff fees or late fees. This lender also offers a 0.50% rate reduction for enrolling in autopay, which is very generous considering most other lenders only offer a 0.25% interest rate discount. Eligible borrowers Must be at least 18 years old Loan amounts $2,000 to $30,000 Loan terms Up to 60 months [ Return to account summary ] See if you're pre-approved for a personal loan offer.\n\nWhat is considered a quick loan?\n\nLoans that can be disbursed as soon as the same business day as approval (or even one business day later) are typically considered quick loans. Most lenders can provide funding in a few days, usually 3\u20135 business days after approval. However, some lenders who disburse funds through a mailed check can take longer to get you the loan proceeds \u2014 usually closer to a week. That's why a quick loan is the ideal solution for someone who wants (or needs) their money ASAP.\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of quick personal loans?\n\nPros No collateral required: Personal loans generally don't require you to secure the loan with an asset. This is good news since you won't be at risk of losing something valuable, like your car, if you default on the loan. However, there will still be implications to your credit score if you fail to repay your loan, as with any other form of credit.\n\nPersonal loans generally don't require you to secure the loan with an asset.

However, there will still be implications to your credit score if you fail to repay your loan, as with any other form of credit. Lower interest rates: Personal loans generally carry lower interest rates compared to credit cards (unless you have a credit card with a 0% intro APR). This makes them a more affordable alternative. Just keep in mind that applying with a higher credit score makes you eligible for.\n\nPersonal loans generally carry lower interest rates compared to credit cards (unless you have a credit card with a 0% intro APR).

Longer repayment terms generally mean lower monthly payments. Lump sum disbursement: Borrowers receive their funding in the form of a lump sum deposited into their bank account. This provides ultimate flexibility in when and how you use the funds. Cons Potentially numerous fees: Unlike credit cards, personal loans often come with origination fees, application fees and sometimes even prepayment penalties. These fees can add onto the cost of borrowing a personal loan. Though, it is possible to find lenders that don't charge these fees.\n\nUnlike credit cards, personal loans often come with origination fees, application fees and sometimes even prepayment penalties. These fees can add onto the cost of borrowing a personal loan. Though, it is possible to find lenders that don't charge these fees. Higher monthly payments: For the most part, credit cards require a low minimum monthly payment (though, experts advise paying off your balance in full each month). With personal loans, though, your monthly payment is often higher than that of credit cards even if you have a long loan term. Granted, you're able to borrow higher amounts with a personal loan than you would with a credit card.\n\nHow do you apply for a quick loan?\n\nFirst, you should compare different quick loans. Many lenders will let you check (for free) on their websites what interest rate you'll likely receive with them. This lets you eliminate the high-rate options and hone in on your preferred lender. Once you've picked your lender, you then apply for a loan. This will trigger a hard inquiry on your credit history, which lowers your score a little, so don't apply for more than one loan if you can help it. The application usually requires you to submit personal information like your address, social security number and the loan purpose. The best way to receive a loan quickly is to ensure all information is accurate and complete. Errors or failure to submit complete information could delay the approval process.\n\nWhat are the credit requirements for a quick loan?\n\nCredit requirements depend on the lender. Most lenders want to see good-to-excellent credit, but a handful of lenders cater to borrowers with fair or poor credit. Be sure to double-check with the lender before applying.\n\nFAQs What is a personal loan? A personal loan is a type of installment credit that allows borrowers to receive a one-time lump sum of cash. Borrowers must then pay back that amount plus interest in regular, monthly installments over the loan's term. How do you apply for a personal loan? When applying for a personal loan, you'll need to provide some basic pieces of information, which can include your address, social security number and date of birth, among others. You may also be required to submit pay stubs as proof of income. Some lenders may also require your bank account information. An application can typically be submitted online or in person if the lender has physical branches that you can visit. How do you get a personal loan with bad credit? Some lenders offer personal loans that cater to borrowers with lower credit scores, and may allow borrowers with bad credit to apply with co-borrowers. It's always advised to try to improve your credit score before applying for any form of credit since it can be difficult to qualify with lower credit scores. Additionally, lower credit scores tend to be subject to higher interest rates. What is an unsecured personal loan? An unsecured loan is a form of credit that doesn't require you to put up collateral that can be used to settle your balance if you default on the loan. Most personal loans are unsecured loans.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhen you need money in a pinch, many personal loan lenders can get you funded as soon as the same business day. Make sure your application is complete and free from inaccuracies to ensure the process goes smoothly. Any mistakes on your application could delay getting your funds.\n\nSubscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter! Money matters \u2014 so make the most of it.

When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans for fair or good credit, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n\nVariable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan.

Creditor payment limits and loan sizes: The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $500 to $100,000. Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. After reviewing the above features, we sorted our recommendations by best for overall financing needs, quick funding, lower interest rates and flexible terms. Note that the rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate per the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

The Bank of America Advantage Savings account stands apart from other brick-and-mortar offerings because of the special rewards programs you can access if you use a Bank of America credit card or open a Bank of America checking account in tandem with your savings account. Account holders can earn up to 15% cash back on select eligible purchases at stores, restaurants and more with BankAmeriDeals\u00ae when using a Bank of America debit or credit card. The Bank of America Advantage Savings account requires a $100 opening deposit. There is an $8-per-month maintenance fee that is waived for the first 6 months for new account holders. Customers can avoid paying the monthly fee after the intro period by maintaining a minimum daily balance of at least $500, linking their savings account to their Bank of America Advantage Relationship Banking\u00ae checking account or becoming a Bank of America Preferred Rewards member. Students under 24 who are enrolled in school may also qualify for a waiver. There are three tiers to the Bank of America's Preferred Rewards program, and your 3-month average daily balance across your Bank of America deposit and Merrill Lynch/Merrill Edge investment accounts determines which tier you qualify for. You must also have an eligible Bank of America personal checking account to qualify. The tiers include Gold, Platinum and Platinum Honors, and there's a $20,000 minimum balance required. If you qualify and enroll in the Preferred Rewards program, you're also eligible for an elevated APY, ranging from 0.02% to 0.04% depending on which tier. Otherwise, the standard APY is 0.01%. To improve your savings habits, consider enrolling in Bank of America's Keep the Change\u00ae program, which allows account holders to round up their debit card purchases and deposit the difference into their savings account each day. Through the Bank of America mobile app, customers can access Erica\u00ae for customized and real-time virtual financial assistance.

With about 5,400 physical locations and over 13,000 ATMs, Wells Fargo Bank is the largest brick-and-mortar bank in the nation by the number of branches. For those looking to open an account at a bank with the most opportunity for in-person access, Wells Fargo is your best choice. Wells Fargo offers two different savings accounts: the basic Way2Save\u00ae Savings and the elevated Platinum Savings. CNBC Select chose Way2Save as the better savings account option because it has a lower minimum daily balance requirement to avoid the monthly service fee ($5 per month for Way2Save and $12 per month for Platinum). To avoid these fees, account holders must either maintain a $300 minimum daily balance or set up their choice of automatic transfers from their checking to their savings: $25 in total, $1 each business day per month or at least one Save As You Go\u00ae transfer. With Save As You Go, it's easy to set aside cash. Wells Fargo automatically transfers $1 of a customer's funds from their linked Wells Fargo checking account to their Way2Save account for each qualifying transaction that is a non-recurring debit card purchase or online bill payment using Wells Fargo Online\u00ae Bill Pay. To accelerate completing your savings goals, you can set up additional automatic transfers from your checking account each month. There is a $25 minimum opening deposit for this savings account, and those who link a Wells Fargo checking account can opt for overdraft protection. The APY on this account is currently 0.15%.\n\nBest at Chase Bank\n\nChase Premier Savings\u2120 Learn More Chase Bank is a Member FDIC.

If you are looking for a broad network of ATMs to avoid any out-of-network fees and want a chance to earn a slightly higher APY, consider the savings accounts offered by Chase. Chase Bank has nearly 4,900 branches and 16,000 ATMs. Like Wells Fargo, Chase offers two brick-and-mortar savings accounts: the standard Chase Savings\u2120 and the Chase Premier Savings\u2120. The latter is stronger because you can earn better interest rates (what Chase calls \"relationship rates\") on higher balances by linking your savings to a Chase Premier Plus Checking\u2120 or Chase Sapphire\u2120 Banking and making at least five transactions in a month using your linked checking account. If you don't link your Chase Premier Savings account to a Chase checking account, the APY is 0.01%. But the APY creeps up slightly if you do have a linked account. For example, you can earn 0.02% APY if you also have a Premier Plus Checking or Chase Sapphire Banking account. By linking to a checking account, you also avoid the monthly $25 service fee that comes with the Chase Premier Savings. Otherwise, there's a daily minimum balance of $15,000 required. There is no minimum deposit required to open an account. If you choose to link a Chase Sapphire Banking account, you can take advantage of Sapphire\u2120 Banking perks, which include special access to sports and entertainment events and early ticket sales. Chase also has an automatic savings program where customers can get help reaching their set savings goals in the bank's mobile app. There is a $5 savings withdrawal limit fee when you make over six withdrawals in a month, including those made at a branch or at an ATM. This fee is waived with a balance of $15,000 or more in the account at the time of withdrawal.\n\nBest at U.S. Bank\n\nU.S. Bank Standard Savings Learn More U.S. Bank National Association is a Member FDIC. Annual Percentage Yield (APY) 0.01% APY\n\nMinimum balance $25 to open\n\nMonthly fee $4 per month, with options to waive\n\nMaximum transactions Up to 6 free withdrawals or transfers per statement cycle\n\nExcessive transactions fee N/A\n\nOverdraft fees Overdraft protection when you link your savings account to your checking account\n\nOffer checking account?

If you want a simple, no-frills and low cost savings account at a brick-and-mortar bank, U.S. Bank's Standard Savings Account is for you. With about 2,700 branches and 4,500 ATMs, U.S. Bank has a smaller physical presence than the other national banks on this list, mostly across the Midwest and Western parts of the U.S. However, as its name suggests, the Standard Savings Account is a straightforward option if you live near a U.S. Bank location. Potential savers can open an account with a $25 minimum deposit. The monthly maintenance fee is $4 a month. The fee is waived for account holders who have a $300 minimum daily balance, a $1,000 average monthly collected balance or are under 18. The APY offered is 0.01% on all balances, and you can take advantage of overdraft protection when linking your savings account to your U.S. Bank checking account.\n\nBest at Citibank\n\nCiti\u00ae Savings Account Learn More Deposit products are provided by Citibank, N.A.

Citi stands out for offering a higher APY than its brick-and-mortar competitors with a 3.85% APY. There is no minimum deposit required to open an account.

PNC Bank is a large brick-and-mortar bank with approximately 2,300 branch locations and nearly 18,000 PNC and PNC Partner ATMs. It stands out on our list for its savings account option called Virtual Wallet\u00ae, which uses innovative online tools to make it easy to see how you're managing your money day to day. The account is best for those who want to do all their banking in one place as it rewards you for combining your savings and checking into one. New account holders can earn a welcome bonus of up to $400 depending on what type of Virtual Wallet they open. The three choices include Virtual Wallet, Virtual Wallet with Performance Spend and Virtual Wallet with Performance Select. The simple Virtual Wallet has basic account features while the two other options offer more premium rewards. For those enrolled in school, there is also a Virtual Wallet Student option. All of the above Virtual Wallet options include individual accounts that work together: Spend, Reserve and Growth. Spend is your everyday checking account, Reserve your interest-bearing checking account / primary overdraft protection account and Growth is your long-term savings account / secondary overdraft protection account. Higher \"relationship\" interest rates are available on your Growth savings account. The monthly service charges range from $7 to $25, depending on the type of Virtual Wallet you have and can be waived depending on minimum balances in your Spend + Reserve checking accounts (required balances and minimum deposits vary according to the type of Virtual Wallet you have). Virtual Wallet account holders can make free transactions at approximately 9,000 PNC-owned ATMs, and if you end up using a non-PNC ATM, some fees are reimbursed. Through the PNC Purchase Payback\u00ae program, customers can also earn cash back or points on purchases made using their PNC Bank Visa\u00ae Debit Card which is automatically issued when they sign up for Virtual Wallet. The customized rewards program has offers available from participating merchants depending on your shopping habits. If you're looking for a more straightforward account, PNC Bank also offers a Standard Savings Account.

Whereas online-only banks don't have to pay high overhead costs to operate physical branches, brick-and-mortar banks have costly expenses that are usually passed on to their customers.\n\nWhy trust CNBC Select?\n\nAt CNBC Select, our mission is to provide our readers with high-quality service journalism and comprehensive consumer advice so they can make informed decisions with their money. Every brick-and-mortar savings account review is based on rigorous reporting by our team of expert writers and editors with extensive knowledge of banking products. While CNBC Select earns a commission from affiliate partners on many offers and links, we create all our content without input from our commercial team or any outside third parties, and we pride ourselves on our journalistic standards and ethics. See our methodology for more information on how we choose the best brick-and-mortar savings accounts.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo determine which brick-and-mortar savings accounts offer the most convenience, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. savings accounts offered by the largest national banks and credit unions. We narrowed down our ranking by only considering those savings accounts that come from brick-and-mortar banks with broad availability, offering access to at least 700 physical branches and over 4,000 non-fee ATMs in the U.S. While the accounts we chose in this article are from the largest banks, we compared each savings account on a range of features, including its fees, opportunities to earn higher interest rates, customer service and any other special offerings or programs. We also considered factors such as insurance policies, users' deposit options, other savings accounts being offered by the same bank and customer reviews when available. All of the accounts included on this list are FDIC-insured up to $250,000. Note that the interest rates and fee structures for brick-and-mortar savings accounts are subject to change without notice. Product and feature availability vary by market so they may not be offered depending on where you live. Most brick-and-mortar banks require you to enter your zip code online for the correct account offerings. Any return on your savings depends on the associated fees and the balance you have in your brick-and-mortar savings account. To open a savings account, most banks and institutions require a deposit of new money, meaning you can't transfer money you already had in an account at that bank.

For a conventional mortgage, lenders typically approve qualified borrowers with a down payment of 5% or more. Anything less than that is considered a low down payment. What are some common types of low-down-payment mortgages? FHA loans, VA loans and USDA loans are all popular types of low-down-payment mortgages insured by government agencies, each with its own eligibility requirements. In addition, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac back HomeReady, Home Possible and HomeOne mortgages. Many banks have proprietary mortgages with low down payments: With Rocket Mortgage's Rocket ONE+ loan, for example, you can put as little as 1% down without private mortgage insurance. Do I have to put down 20% to buy a home? The median down payment for first-time homebuyers between July 2022 and June 2023 was 8%, according to the National Association of Realtors. Putting less than 20% down, however, will likely mean you'll have to pay private mortgage insurance.\n\nSubscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter! Money matters \u2014 so make the most of it.

Minimum down payment: Although minimum down payment amounts depend on the type of loan a borrower applies for, we noted lenders that offer additional specialty loans that come with a lower minimum down payment amount. After reviewing the above features, we sorted our recommendations by best for no down payment, affordability, no lender fees, low-income borrowers, VA loans, USDA loans and online lenders. Rates and fee structures advertised for mortgages fluctuate in accordance with the Federal Reserve rate. However, once you accept your mortgage agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee your interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan, unless you choose to refinance your mortgage at a later date for a potentially lower APR. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history, creditworthiness, debt-to-income ratio and the desired loan term. To take out a mortgage, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.
