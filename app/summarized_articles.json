        "text": "Amazon loses money on Echo smart speakers. It\u2019s been an open secret for the duration of Alexa\u2019s existence. It\u2019s the product of the kind of loss leader strategy only a company of Amazon\u2019s size can get away with for a decade.\n\nSelling hardware at a loss can be an effective strategy, of course. Think about printers and razors, which get corporate feet into the door and make up for the loss with ink cartridges and blades, respectively.\n\nFrom the perspective of saturation, Amazon\u2019s strategy can be viewed as a success. Early this year, founder Jeff Bezos claimed that Alexa is now in 100 million homes, across 400 million devices.\n\nFinancial realities paint a wholly different picture, however. According to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, Amazon\u2019s devices division lost a staggering $25 billion in the five-year period between 2017 and 2021. The Alexa division reportedly lost $10 billion in 2022 alone.\n\nAt a certain point, a loss leader simply becomes a loss. That reality came crashing down at the end of 2023, when several hundred were laid off from the Alexa unit. Eleven-digit annual losses, coupled with a rough macroeconomic outlook, is an untenable situation, even for a company with $600 billion+ in annual revenue.\n\nAlexa isn\u2019t the only smart assistant that has fallen back down to Earth in recent years. Beyond offerings like Bixby and Cortana, which went away entirely, consumer excitement around Google Assistant and Siri has also waned.\n\nIn recent months, however, both Google and Apple have made it clear that they\u2019re not ready to give up the ghost. Siri took center stage at WWDC in June, as Apple breathed new life into the brand, courtesy of its new Apple Intelligence initiative. Google similarly confirmed this week that Assistant is getting a Gemini-powered boost in the home.\n\nA 2021 report from Bloomberg noted that, despite Alexa\u2019s popularity, a majority of queries involve one of three tasks: playing music, controlling lights and setting timers.\n\nA former Amazon senior employee put it even more starkly, speaking to WSJ: \u201cWe worried we\u2019ve hired 10,000 people and we\u2019ve built a smart timer.\u201d With all the published criticism leveled at Alexa in its decade-long existence, that may well be the most effortlessly cutting.\n\nWhile the company has continued releasing Echo devices, including an upgraded Spot announced last month, the company has taken its foot off the gas. No doubt there has been much soul searching among the Spheres. Much like Google and Apple, Amazon sees generative AI as the lifeline Alexa needs.\n\nThe 10,000-person timer problem is a result of devices failing to live up to customer expectations. Entreating third-party developers to create skills has been part of a larger push to make Alexa more useful. Amazon has also attempted to improve the assistant\u2019s conversational skills over the years.\n\nIn that respect, generative AI is a game changer. Platforms like ChatGPT have demonstrated incredible natural language conversational aptitude. Late last year, Amazon offered a preview of Alexa\u2019s generative AI-powered future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always thought of Alexa as an evolving service, and we\u2019ve been continuously improving it since the day we introduced it in 2014,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cA longstanding mission has been to make a conversation with Alexa as natural as talking to another human, and with the rapid development of generative AI, what we imagined is now well within reach.\u201d\n\nNovember marks a decade since Alexa and Echo were announced. One couldn\u2019t ask for better timing to unveil a picture of what the next 10 years might look like. Whether the assistant gets another decade will depend, in part, on how the next few months play out.",

        "title": "Maybe Friend wasn\u2019t crazy for spending $1.8M on a domain after all",
        "text": "When AI companion startup Friend revealed it had spent $1.8 million on buying the www.friend.com domain name last week, it set off a debate around what exactly branding is worth, and how startups should be spending cash. Founders of other companies like Loom and Public came forward to share stories of their own quests to lock down a domain, but the questions continued rolling in: Did Friend overspend for its domain? Will it really make a difference?\n\nAvi Schiffmann, the founder and CEO of Friend, told TechCrunch over email that the purchase has already paid for itself. And there may be a method to the madness, given that buying domain names for millions of dollars isn\u2019t particularly a new thing \u2014 Tesla paid an estimated $10 million over the span of a decade for \u201ctesla.com,\u201d and mortgage startup Better.com paid $1.8 million for its domain in 2015, the year it was founded. And according to some reports, OpenAI apparently paid $11 million for \u201cai.com.\u201d\n\nAlex Harris, a co-founder of startup marketing firm Fiat Growth and founding GP at early-stage VC firm Fiat Ventures, told TechCrunch getting the name, domain and branding right can have a big impact on how a company grows.\n\nThe right name or domain can help startups be not only easy to find but also easy to remember, Harris said. He added that \u201c.com\u201d domains are king (sorry \u201c.ai\u201d companies) \u2014 and shorter is always better when it comes to names or domains.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, the name is critical when there is any kind of word-of-mouth [promotion],\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe name is easy to spell, easy to say. These are some of the things we talk about that are really quite simple, but a lot of people ignore [them].\u201d\n\nOlivier Toubia, a marketing professor at Columbia Business School, said one nuance to consider when thinking of a name is how often you want customers to interact with your business. If it\u2019s a consumer product that users will turn to often, or a software that businesses will use every day, coming up with something unique and memorable, like Google or Twitter, could be a smart play.\n\nAnd if a company\u2019s product is something that users turn to less often, or only when they need to, it\u2019s better to choose a name that is generic enough to easily come up on search engines.\n\n\u201cIf you [are] a product or service that [people] won\u2019t necessarily use very frequently or maybe when they need you, they will Google or search for you,\u201d Toubia said, pointing to how someone may search for a locksmith if they were locked out of their apartment.\n\nAnd in the case of startups that customers don\u2019t interact with on a daily basis \u2014think healthcare companies \u2014 most of the big ones like Spring Health and Cityblock Health all have \u201chealth\u201d in their name to make it clear what they do and likely for SEO.\n\nHarris feels getting the name and domain right also adds a touch of legitimacy to a business. A professional-sounding name and domain helps people trust a company if they haven\u2019t heard of it before, be they customers, potential hires, or even investors.\n\n\u201cWe all get emails from [companies] with a super long domain or weird domain extension, and it de-legitimizes it,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIf you have a domain that is desirable, [people] pay attention.\u201d\n\nHarris also feels spending $1.8 million on a domain, as Friend did, isn\u2019t as crazy as it may seem at first. He said that if buying that domain helps the company\u2019s business, which he predicts it will, that purchase will pay for itself over time. And a good domain like that can double as solid IP that can be sold if needed.\n\nCaution.com\n\nLarger companies can probably afford to spend millions on branding, but does it make sense for startups that are still building a product and going to market?\n\nHarris and Toubia both warned that there are things to keep in mind here, of course. In Friend\u2019s case, both said the amount of money spent on buying the domain name is only going to be worth it if it isn\u2019t preventing the startup from actually building a product.\n\n\u201cThe name is important, but you have to sell and develop a product,\u201d Toubia said. \u201cIf you already burned 70% of the cash and don\u2019t have a product, investors may not be very happy with that. That may hurt your ability to raise [more money] in the future.\u201d\n\nThere are clear advantages to locking in your branding early on, but companies must also make sure they don\u2019t paint themselves into a corner with name or branding that could make it hard for them to pivot later, Toubia said. If a company completely changes its business down the line, or chooses a name that is subject to legal action, that early branding could prove costly.\n\nIt could also be risky to choose a name that is too similar to another company\u2019s. If the companies are in wildly different sectors and wouldn\u2019t confuse a potential customer, it probably won\u2019t matter. But the stakes change dramatically if a company with a similar name commits fraud or another act that would result in a less-than-ideal association.\n\nEven in less drastic terms, if a name is too similar, it could just cause general confusion, Harris said, like in the case of former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani\u2019s press conference at the Four Seasons Total Landscaping a few years ago.\n\nRegardless of how Friend\u2019s decision to purchase their costly domain works out, both Harris and Toubia both said the fact that we are talking about their decision to do so shows their strategy might already be working.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like naming a kid,\u201d Harris said. \u201cYou get to the point where you say, I almost don\u2019t care anymore; these five names are fine, just pick one and be done with it. In that moment of frustration, be patient and push through. It is very important. Don\u2019t settle on something because it\u2019s easy, because it\u2019s cheap. Think about the assets available and who you are competing against.\u201d",

        "text": "From internet protocols and operating systems, to databases and cloud services, some technology is so omnipresent most people don\u2019t even know it exists. The same can be said about OpenStreetMap, the community-driven platform that serves companies and software developers with geographic data and maps so they can rely a little less on the proprietary incumbents in the space. Yes, that mostly means Google.\n\nOpenStreetMap is the handiwork of Steve Coast (pictured above), a University College London \u201cdropout\u201d (Coast\u2019s own words) who has since gone on to work in various map- and location-related roles at Microsoft, TomTom, Telenav, and \u2014 as of today \u2014 Singaporean ride-hailing firm Grab.\n\nCoast isn\u2019t directly involved on a day-to-day basis at OpenStreetMap any more, but in a blog post on Friday marking his creation\u2019s 20th anniversary, he acknowledged two preceding success stories from the open source realm that convinced him that something like OpenStreetMap might have legs.\n\n\u201cTwo decades ago, I knew that a wiki map of the world would work,\u201d Coast wrote. \u201cIt seemed obvious in light of the success of Wikipedia and Linux. But I didn\u2019t know that OpenStreetMap would work until much later.\u201d\n\nWhile OpenStreetMap is a little like Wikipedia for maps, the comparison with its encyclopaedic counterpart is somewhat superficial. Sure, they are both gargantuan collaborative projects, but there is a world of difference between sharing your geeky knowledge of micronations and mapping out geographic features on a global scale.\n\nToday, OpenStreetMap claims more than 10 million contributors who map out and fine-tune everything from streets and buildings, to rivers, canyons and everything else that constitutes our built and natural environments. The starting point for all this is data derived from various sources, including publicly available and donated aerial imagery and maps, sourced from governments and private organizations such as Microsoft. Contributors can manually add and edit data through OpenStreetMap\u2019s editing tools, and they can even venture out into the wild and map a whole new area out by themselves using GPS, which is useful if a new street crops up, for example.\n\nOpenSteetMap editor Image Credits: OpenSteetMap\n\nAs sole creator, Coast was the driving force behind all the early software development and advocacy work, eventually setting up the U.K.-based non-profit OpenStreetMap Foundation to oversee the project in 2006. Today, the Foundation is supported primarily by donations and memberships, with less than a dozen volunteer board members (who are elected by members) steering key decisions and managing finances. The Foundation counts just a single employee \u2014 a system engineer \u2014 and a handful of contractors who provide administrative and accounting support.\n\nOpenStreetMap\u2019s Open Database License (ODbL) allows any third-party to use its data with the appropriate attribution (though this attribution doesn\u2019t always happen). This includes big-name corporations such as Apple and VC-backed unicorns like MapBox, through a who\u2019s who of tech companies including Uber and Strava, the latter tapping OpenStreetMap data for roads, trails, parks, points of interest, and more.\n\nMore recently, the Overture Maps Foundation \u2014 an initiative backed by Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and TomTom \u2014 has leaned heavily on OpenStreetMap data as part of its own efforts to build a viable alternative to Google\u2019s walled mapping garden.\n\nThere\u2019s little question that OpenStreetMap has been a success these past 20 years, a success that wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the internet and people\u2019s desire to create something valuable that\u2019s owned by everyone.\n\n\u201cOpenStreetMap managed to map the world and give the data away for free for almost no money at all,\u201d Coast notes. \u201cIt managed to sidestep almost all the problems that Wikipedia has by virtue of only representing facts not opinions. If OpenStreetMap is a medium, what is the message? For me it\u2019s that we can go from nothing to something, or zero to one.\u201d\n\nBesides affordability and accessibility, there is at least one other good reason why an open map dataset should exist, and it all comes down to the notion of who gets to \u201cown\u201d location. Should corporate juggernauts such as Google really get to control it all? By any reasonable estimation, a location monopoly is not a positive thing for society.\n\nAs OpenStreetMap contributor and free software advocate Serge Wroclawski notes: \u201cPlace is a shared resource, and when you give all that power to a single entity, you are giving them the power not only to tell you about your location, but to shape it.\u201d",

        "text": "Elon Musk doesn\u2019t want Tesla to be just an automaker. He wants Tesla to be an AI company, one that\u2019s figured out how to make cars drive themselves.\n\nCrucial to that mission is Dojo, Tesla\u2019s custom-built supercomputer designed to train its Full Self-Driving (FSD) neural networks. FSD isn\u2019t actually fully self-driving; it can perform some automated driving tasks, but still requires an attentive human behind the wheel. But Tesla thinks with more data, more compute power and more training, it can cross the threshold from almost self-driving to full self-driving.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where Dojo comes in.\n\nMusk has been teasing Dojo for some time, but the executive has been ramping up discussions about the supercomputer throughout 2024. Dojo\u2019s importance to Tesla might be existential \u2013 with EV sales slumping, investors want assurances that Tesla can achieve autonomy. Below is a timeline of Dojo mentions and promises.\n\n2019\n\nFirst mentions of Dojo\n\nApril 22 \u2013 At Tesla\u2019s Autonomy Day, the automaker had its AI team up on stage to talk about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, and the AI powering them both. The company shares information about Tesla\u2019s custom-built chips that are designed specifically for neural networks and self-driving cars.\n\nDuring the event, Musk teases Dojo, revealing that it\u2019s a supercomputer for training AI. He also notes that all Tesla cars being produced at the time would have all hardware necessary for full self-driving and only needed a software update.\n\n2020\n\nMusk begins the Dojo roadshow\n\nFeb 2 \u2013 Musk says Tesla will soon have more than a million connected vehicles worldwide with sensors and compute needed for full self-driving \u2014 and touts Dojo\u2019s capabilities.\n\n\u201cDojo, our training supercomputer, will be able to process vast amounts of video training data & efficiently run hyperspace arrays with a vast number of parameters, plenty of memory & ultra-high bandwidth between cores. More on this later.\u201d\n\nAugust 14 \u2013 Musk reiterates Tesla\u2019s plan to develop a neural network training computer called Dojo \u201cto process truly vast amounts of video data,\u201d calling it \u201ca beast.\u201d He also says the first version of Dojo is \u201cabout a year away,\u201d which would put its launch date somewhere around August 2021.\n\nDecember 31 \u2014 Elon says Dojo isn\u2019t needed, but it will make self-driving better. \u201cIt isn\u2019t enough to be safer than human drivers, Autopilot ultimately needs to be more than 10 times safer than human drivers.\u201d\n\n2021\n\nTesla makes Dojo official\n\nAugust 19 \u2013 The automaker officially announces Dojo at Tesla\u2019s first AI Day, an event meant to attract engineers to Tesla\u2019s AI team. Tesla also introduces its D1 chip, which the automaker says it will use \u2014 alongside Nvidia\u2019s GPU \u2014 to power the Dojo supercomputer. Tesla notes its AI cluster will house 3,000 D1 chips.\n\nOctober 12 \u2013 Tesla releases a Dojo Technology whitepaper, \u201ca guide to Tesla\u2019s configurable floating point formats & arithmetic.\u201d The whitepaper outlines a technical standard for a new type of binary floating-point arithmetic that\u2019s used in deep learning neural networks and can be implemented \u201centirely in software, entirely in hardware, or in any combination of software and hardware.\u201d\n\n2022\n\nTesla reveals Dojo progress\n\nAugust 12 \u2013 Musk says Tesla will \u201cphase in Dojo. Won\u2019t need to buy as many incremental GPUs next year.\u201d\n\nSeptember 30 \u2013 At Tesla\u2019s second AI Day, the company reveals that it has installed the first Dojo cabinet, testing 2.2 megawatts of load testing. Tesla says it was building one tile per day (which is made up of 25 D1 chips). Tesla demos Dojo onstage running a Stable Diffusion model to create an AI-generated image of a \u201cCybertruck on Mars.\u201d\n\nImportantly, the company sets a target date of a full Exapod cluster to be completed by Q1 2023, and says it plans to build a total of seven Exapods in Palo Alto.\n\n2023\n\nA \u2018long-shot bet\u2018\n\nApril 19 \u2013 Musk tells investors during Tesla\u2019s first-quarter earnings that Dojo \u201chas the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training,\u201d and also \u201chas the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services.\u201d\n\nMusk also notes that he\u2019d \u201clook at Dojo as kind of a long-shot bet,\u201d but a \u201cbet worth making.\u201d\n\nJune 21 \u2014 The Tesla AI X account posts that the company\u2019s neural networks are already in customer vehicles. The thread includes a graph with a timeline of Tesla\u2019s current and projected compute power, which places the start of Dojo production at July 2023, although it\u2019s not clear if this refers to the D1 chips or the supercomputer itself. Musk says that same day that Dojo was already online and running tasks at Tesla data centers.\n\nThe company also projects that Tesla\u2019s compute will be the top five in the entire world by around February 2024 (there are no indications this was successful) and that Tesla would reach 100 exaflops by October 2024.\n\nJuly 19 \u2013 Tesla notes in its second-quarter earnings report it has started production of Dojo. Musk also says Tesla plans to spend more than $1 billion on Dojo through 2024.\n\nSeptember 6 \u2013 Musk posts on X that Tesla is limited by AI training compute, but that Nvidia and Dojo will fix that. He says managing the data from the roughly 160 billion frames of video Tesla gets from its cars per day is extremely difficult.\n\n2024\n\nPlans to scale\n\nJanuary 24 \u2013 During Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter and full-year earnings call, Musk acknowledges again that Dojo is a high-risk, high-reward project. He also says that Tesla was pursuing \u201cthe dual path of Nvidia and Dojo,\u201d that \u201cDojo is working,\u201d and is \u201cdoing training jobs.\u201d He notes Tesla is scaling it up and has \u201cplans for Dojo 1.5, Dojo 2, Dojo 3 and whatnot.\u201d\n\nJanuary 26 \u2013 Tesla announced plans to spend $500 million to build a Dojo supercomputer in Buffalo. Musk then downplays the investment somewhat, posting on X that while $500 million is a large sum, it\u2019s \u201conly equivalent to a 10k H100 system from Nvidia. Tesla will spend more than that on Nvidia hardware this year. The table stakes for being competitive in AI are at least several billion dollars per year at this point.\u201d\n\nApril 30 \u2013 At TSMC\u2019s North American Technology Symposium, the company says Dojo\u2019s next-generation training tile \u2014 the D2, which puts the entire Dojo tile onto a single silicon wafer, rather than connecting 25 chips to make one tile \u2014 is already in production, according to IEEE Spectrum.\n\nMay 20 \u2013 Musk notes that the rear portion of the Giga Texas factory extension will include the construction of \u201ca super dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster.\u201d\n\nJune 4 \u2013 A CNBC report reveals Musk diverted thousands of Nvidia chips reserved for Tesla to X and xAI. After initially saying the report was false, Musk posts on X that Tesla didn\u2019t have a location to send the Nvidia chips to turn them on, due to the continued construction on the south extension of Giga Texas, \u201cso they would have just sat in a warehouse.\u201d He noted the extension will \u201chouse 50k H100s for FSD training.\u201d\n\nHe also posts:\n\n\u201cOf the roughly $10B in AI-related expenditures I said Tesla would make this year, about half is internal, primarily the Tesla-designed AI inference computer and sensors present in all of our cars, plus Dojo. For building the AI training superclusters, NVidia hardware is about 2/3 of the cost. My current best guess for Nvidia purchases by Tesla are $3B to $4B this year.\u201d\n\nJuly 1 \u2013 Musk reveals on X that current Tesla vehicles may not have the right hardware for the company\u2019s next-gen AI model. He says that the roughly 5x increase in parameter count with the next-gen AI \u201cis very difficult to achieve without upgrading the vehicle inference computer.\u201d\n\nNvidia supply challenges\n\nJuly 23 \u2013 During Tesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings call, Musk says demand for Nvidia hardware is \u201cso high that it\u2019s often difficult to get the GPUs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this therefore requires that we put a lot more effort on Dojo in order to ensure that we\u2019ve got the training capability that we need,\u201d Musk says. \u201cAnd we do see a path to being competitive with Nvidia with Dojo.\u201d\n\nA graph in Tesla\u2019s investor deck predicts that Tesla AI training capacity will ramp to roughly 90,000 H100 equivalent GPUs by the end of 2024, up from around 40,000 in June. Later that day on X, Musk posts that Dojo 1 will have \u201croughly 8k H100-equivalent of training online by end of year.\u201d He also posts photos of the supercomputer, which appears to use the same fridge-like stainless steel exterior as Tesla\u2019s Cybertrucks.\n\nXXX\n\nJuly 30 \u2013 AI5 is ~18 months away from high-volume production, Musk says in a reply to a post from someone claiming to start a club of \u201cTesla HW4/AI4 owners angry about getting left behind when AI5 comes out.\u201d\n\nAugust 3 \u2013 Musk posts on X that he did a walkthrough of \u201cthe Tesla supercompute cluster at Giga Texas (aka Cortex).\u201d He notes that it would be made roughly of 100,000 H100/H200 Nvidia GPUs with \u201cmassive storage for video training of FSD & Optimus.\u201d",

        "text": "The state of enforcement of the European Union\u2019s flagship privacy regime, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), on the most powerful tech giants remains a topic of ongoing debate. Below we\u2019ve compiled a list of the 10 largest GDPR fines imposed on Big Tech since the regulation started to apply back in May 2018.\n\nMeta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, tops the list, both for receiving the single biggest fine to date (\u20ac1.2 billion or around $1.31 billion at current exchange rates) and because it accounts for a majority of these largest penalties (six or more, depending on whether you count per platform).\n\nPlease note this list only includes major penalties issued to tech firms under the GDPR. In recent years, some significant sanctions have also been issued on Big Tech via the bloc\u2019s older ePrivacy Directive, but you won\u2019t find those listed here.\n\nPenalties issued to tech firms under GDPR\n\n1. Meta (Facebook): Fined \u20ac1.2 billion (~$1.31 billion) in May 2023 by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) for violating the rules on transferring Facebook users\u2019 personal data out of the European Union.\n\n2. Amazon: Fined \u20ac746 million (~$815 million) in July 2021 by Luxembourg\u2019s National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD) following complaints that its use of personal data for ad targeting was not based on consent.\n\n3. Meta (Instagram): Fined \u20ac405 million (~$443 million) in September 2021 by Ireland\u2019s DPC for failings in its handling of minors\u2019 data.\n\n4. Meta (Instagram and Facebook): Fined a total of \u20ac390 million (~$426 million) in January 2023 by Ireland\u2019s DPC for failing to have a valid legal basis to process user data for ad targeting.\n\n5. ByteDance (TikTok): Fined \u20ac345 million (~$377 million) in September 2023 by Ireland\u2019s DPC for failings in its handling of minors\u2019 data.\n\n6. Meta (Facebook and Instagram): Fined \u20ac265 million (~$290 million) in November 2022 by Ireland\u2019s DPC for breaches of data protection by default and design after certain platform features, including contact importer and search tools, made the personal data of hundreds of millions of users discoverable to all other users.\n\n7. Meta (WhatsApp): Fined \u20ac225 million (~$246 million) in September 2021 by Ireland\u2019s DPC for breaking GDPR transparency obligations and failing to make it clear to users how it processes their data.\n\n8. Alphabet/Google (Android): Fined \u20ac50 million (~$55 million) in January 2019 by France\u2019s National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL) for transparency and consent failings related to its Android mobile platform.\n\n9. Meta (Facebook): Fined \u20ac17 million (~$18.5 million) in March 2022 by the Irish DPC for a string of security breaches thought to have affected up to 30 million users.\n\n10. ByteDance (TikTok): Fined around \u20ac14.8 million at current exchange rates (~$16 million) in April 2023 by the U.K.\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) in another case related to minor protection. (Note: Despite the U.K. no longer being in the EU, its data protection rules are still based on the GDPR.)\n\nNot strictly Big Tech but worth a mention\n\nAdtech giant Criteo was issued with a preliminary fine of \u20ac60 million (~$65 million) in August 2022 by France\u2019s CNIL for a range of GDPR breaches. But in June 2023, the level of penalty was reduced to \u20ac40 million (~$44 million) after the adtech giant made representations. The enforcement followed complaints that Criteo did not have users\u2019 consent for tracking and profiling them for ad targeting.\n\nAnother bonus mention: U.S.-based AI startup Clearview AI was fined the maximum possible (\u20ac20 million or around $22 million, based on its revenue) a full three times in 2022 by data protection authorities in Italy, Greece and France. The sanctions were for unlawful data processing as a result of its tactic of scraping selfies off the internet to train a facial-recognition ID-matching AI tool. In the same year, the U.K.\u2019s ICO also hit it with a smaller sanction for GDPR breaches, so the controversial startup\u2019s activities have drawn a lot of enforcement.",

        "title": "Protecting women from deceitful men or criminalizing break-ups? A new law in India stirs debate",
        "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nMen who deceitfully break off promises of marriage after having sex with a woman could face up to 10 years in prison, as Indian law grapples with a widespread but often ignored form of sexual abuse.\n\nBut the new law has also provoked questions about how it will be applied, whether it can effectively protect women from sexual exploitation and whether it risks criminalizing break-ups.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government introduced a new criminal code in early July, replacing India\u2019s 164-year-old colonial-era penal code.\n\nSection 69 of the new statute criminalizes having sex with a woman \u201cby making a promise to marry (her) without any intention of\u201d doing so, or by \u201cdeceitful means\u201d such as falsely promising career advancement or marrying under a fake identity.\n\nThe crime is punishable by up to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine.\n\nThough the law is new, the concept is not \u2013 many women have previously brought such cases to court, accusing men of luring them into sexual relationships by dangling promises of marriage.\n\nIndian society has generally conservative attitudes towards sex, with a strong emphasis on female virginity and often pricy dowry negotiations attached to unions. Premarital and extramarital sex therefore remain taboo for many \u2013 and any suggestion of impropriety may make it more difficult for a woman to secure a marriage.\n\nAudrey Dmello, director of Majlis Law, a women\u2019s rights NGO in India, supports the new law. She argues \u201cpromise to marry\u201d rape cases are under-reported and needed to be tackled through legislation.\n\n\u201cHaving such a law gives women validity as to what happened to them,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nProtestors hold placards and shout slogans during a march for women's rights in New Delhi, India, on April 4, 2019. Burhaan Kinu/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nConflicting rulings\n\nUnder the old penal code, courts have previously ruled that having sex under false pretenses is not consensual, giving rise to rape convictions.\n\nBut judges have issued conflicting rulings on \u201cpromise to marriage\u201d cases, something the new law is trying to address.\n\nIn 2019, the Supreme Court heard a case where the plaintiff alleged rape after having been in a long-term romantic and sexual relationship with the defendant, who later expressed reservations about getting married due to caste differences, as detailed in court documents.\n\nIndia\u2019s caste system was officially abolished in 1950, but the 2,000-year-old social hierarchy still exists in many aspects of life. The caste system categorizes Hindus at birth, defining their place in society, what jobs they can do and who they can marry.\n\nThe man in the 2019 case was acquitted, with the court ruling that a broken promise was different to a false promise of marriage: the man had to have made the promise with no intention of fulfilling it from the start. Since the woman continued the relationship even knowing there were obstacles to them getting married, it didn\u2019t count as rape, the court ruled.\n\nHowever, in the same year India\u2019s top court gave a different ruling in a similar case. It upheld the rape conviction by a doctor in the central state of Chhattisgarh because he had a sexual relationship with a woman after he\u2019d promised to marry her, but then broke his promise and married someone else, according to court documents.\n\nHe was sentenced to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of 50,000 rupees (about $600).\n\nThese different rulings show \u201ceven the judges are confused,\u201d said Tanvir Siddiki, a legal advocate based in Varanasi.\n\n\u201cYou can see that the (one court) is saying one thing, and the Supreme Court of India is saying another thing on the very issue of \u2018promise of marriage,\u2019\u201d he added.\n\nIndian society has generally conservative attitudes towards sex, with a strong emphasis on female virginity and often pricy dowry negotiations attached to unions.\n\nPotential concerns\n\nThe new law distinguishes \u201cpromise to marry\u201d cases from rape \u2013 but some lawyers say the parameters are still vague.\n\nSome have questioned how the law will be implemented, arguing that it will be difficult to prove deceit and the intention to marry in court.\n\n\u201cHow can one prove a person\u2019s intention? In the real world, even if such a situation occurs the accused would only tell his true intentions to his confidant, he wouldn\u2019t tell the victim that,\u201d said Gopal Krishna, a legal advocate in Varanasi and a legal coordinator for a local NGO for women, Guria India.\n\nSiddiki added that under the previous penal code, rape victims \u2013 including those in \u201cpromise to marriage\u201d cases \u2013 were required to undergo medical exams, which are no longer required under the new class of case.\n\n\u201cWithout this, how will the prosecution then prove that the victim was sexually exploited?\u201d he said.\n\nMoreover, the law has shifted the burden of proof onto the victim, experts told CNN.\n\nA couple pictured on a beach in Mumbai, India, on February 21, 2023.\n\nMixed opinions\n\nSome younger Indians have voiced skepticism over the law\u2019s relevance in today\u2019s increasingly progressive India where traditions of arranged marriages and historic conservative attitudes towards dating and pre-marital sex are shifting, especially in more urban and middle-class communities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in a time where people are becoming modern and are choosing to stay in relationships without wanting to get married,\u201d said Durjoy Biswas, a 21-year-old resident of Kolkata in West Bengal state.\n\nAnd 19-year-old Delhi resident Vanshika Bhattad questioned what role the law should play when it comes to sex among two consenting adults.\n\n\u201cEven if the guy is lying about marriage, having sexual intercourse is the consent of both parties, the emphasis should be on consent. If someone forcefully has sex with a girl then it is rape,\u201d he said.\n\nBut while many social media users have voiced fear over the potential abuse of Section 69 against men, Dmello of Majlis Law argued that the law empowers women and places them on equal footing with men.\n\n\u201cIn our society, we always tell women to do this and that \u2013 do not go out at night, do not wear such clothes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe tables have turned now.\u201d",

        "text": "Vinhedo, Brazil CNN \u2014\n\nA passenger plane carrying 62 people crashed outside S\u00e3o Paulo on Friday afternoon, killing everyone on board.\n\nDramatic footage circulating on social media showed the plane\u2019s fall and its destroyed fuselage in flames on the ground.\n\nRegional airline Voepass revised the number of fatalities up to 62 from 61 after confirming another passenger was on board. It earlier said that there were 57 passengers and four crew members on board.\n\nAll of the passengers had Brazilian documents, airline officials said. Portugal\u2019s foreign ministry said on Saturday that one Portuguese citizen traveling on the plane died in the crash. It is unclear if that passenger or any other victims had dual citizenship.\n\nFlight tracking data shows that the ATR 72-500, a twin-engine turboprop plane, dropped 17,000 feet in just one minute, but it is not yet clear why.\n\nSocial media videos of the crash showed the plane spiraling out of the sky before hitting the ground as people in the neighborhood shouted in fear. Another video showed the wreckage of the plane in flames on the ground. No one on the ground was hurt, city officials told CNN.\n\nA plane is seen falling out of the sky into the city of Vinhedo, Brazil, on August 9. Obtained by CNN\n\nThe flight left Cascavel, in the Brazilian state of Parana, and was en route to Guarulhos, in S\u00e3o Paulo state, when it lost signal shortly before 1:30 p.m. (12:30 p.m. ET), according to Flightradar24 data.\n\nIt began losing altitude a minute and a half before crashing. The plane had been cruising at 17,000 feet until 1:21 p.m., when it dropped approximately 250 feet in 10 seconds. It then climbed approximately 400 feet in about eight seconds.\n\nEight seconds later, it lost just under 2,000 feet. Then, in approximately one minute, it began rapidly descending \u2013 losing roughly 17,000 feet in just one minute.\n\nThe last data transmission from the plane was at 1:22 p.m.\n\nLuiz Augusto De Oliveira described the moment the plane struck part of his property. \u201cThe plane crashed at my house,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cThere were three people in the house - me, my wife and the maid - we are all fine.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe thought it was a helicopter in breakdown due to the noise \u2026 and suddenly we saw the aircraft exploding in the garage of my house.\u201d\n\nA passenger plane carrying 62 people crashed in Brazil on August 9, 2024.\n\nCause not yet known\n\nThere is no information yet on what caused the crash, Voepass CEO Eduardo Busch told a press conference.\n\n\u201cThe entire crew was competent,\u201d Busch said. \u201cWe are waiting for access to all communications between the pilot and the control tower to have a broader understanding of what happened.\u201d\n\nBusch said the plane had two black boxes \u2013 devices that store flight data which are built to withstand crashes \u2013 and that there are two highly qualified laboratories available to analyze them.\n\nAuthorities have so far retrieved 24 bodies from the crash site, Vinhedo mayor Dar\u00edo Pacheco told a press conference on Saturday.\n\nOf those, two victims \u2013 the pilot and the co-pilot \u2013 have been preliminarily identified based on visual recognition, he said, who added that the aircraft\u2019s black boxes had been recovered in working order and sent to Brasilia for analysis.\n\nEarlier, Sao Paulo fire brigade spokesperson Maycon Cristo said all the victims were still seated during the crash and no bodies were ejected from the site due to the plane crashing flat onto ground, Cristo said.\n\n\u201cOfficials are working row by row (of the crashed aircraft) to retrieve and identify the bodies,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the bodies are in such conditions that it\u2019s difficult to identify.\n\nThe recovery team is working from the cockpit and moving towards the tail, where the forensic work will be harder due to the damage caused by the fire following the crash, according to the spokesperson.\n\nPlane debris can be seen at the impact site in Vinhedo, Sao Paulo state, Brazil, early on Saturday. Andre Penner/AP\n\nIn order to help identify bodies, families have been asked to share medical documentation of the victims \u201csuch as radiological, medical and/or dental exams,\u201d said a statement released by the government of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nInterrupting a speech at an afternoon naval event to address the crash, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva called for a minute of silence to mark the apparent deaths of the flight\u2019s passengers and crew.\n\n\u201cI would like everyone to stand up so that we can observe a minute of silence because a plane has just crashed in the city of Vinhedo\u2026 and it appears they all died,\u201d he said, in a video of his statement shared on X.\n\nThe president later declared three days of mourning for the victims.\n\nVoepass officials said that the company spent the afternoon securing hotels and psychologists for the victims\u2019 families and providing them with support.\n\nOne resident recorded video of the aftermath of a plane crashing into her neighbor\u2019s house outside of S\u00e3o Paulo, telling CNN she was eating lunch in her kitchen when she saw the plane going down.\n\nShe ducked down in terror and started praying, she said, calling it a \u201cmoment of panic\u201d for the whole city. Private roads leading up to the properties are now closed off to everyone, including residents, she said, and first responders are in the area.\n\nAn aerial view of the wreckage of the Voepass flight traveling from Cascavel to Guarulhos that crashed killing all on board. Nelson Almeida/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAn investigation begins\n\nVinhedo City Hall said in the Friday statement that it is waiting for the Brazil Air Force team to start investigating the cause of the crash.\n\nBrigadier Marcelo Moreno, who heads Brazil\u2019s aviation accidents agency CENIPA, told a press conference that aircraft crew had not communicated an emergency prior to the crash. \u201cPreliminarily, we have this information that there was no information about the aircraft, that the aircraft was in any type of emergency whatsoever,\u201d he told a press conference.\n\nBusch, the Voepass CEO, said the airline will work closely with CENIPA to investigate the crash.\n\nAccording to registration data from the Brazilian Aeronautical Registry, the Voepass airplane was manufactured in 2010 and purchased by the airline in September 2022.\n\nThe aircraft was \u201cdenied operation for air taxi,\u201d according to its registration data. But it\u2019s unclear why or when that determination was made at this time.\n\nCNN has reached out to Brazil\u2019s aviation authority for more details about that determination.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback What video of Brazil plane falling from sky tells expert about what happened 02:15 - Source: CNN\n\nATR, the plane\u2019s manufacturer, says it was aware of an accident and is working to support investigators.\n\n\u201cWhat we can say at this point in time is that ATR has been informed that an accident occurred in Vinhedo, Brazil involving an ATR 72-500. Our first thoughts are with all the individuals affected by this event. The ATR specialists are fully engaged to support both the investigation and the customer,\u201d the statement said.\n\nFlight experts speaking to CNN said ATR 72s, which are constructed by a European consortium, have a checkered past. There have been at least 15 incidents resulting in passenger deaths involving ATR turboprops recorded around the world.\n\nPassengers who missed flight \u2018thank God\u2019\n\nSome people missed the tragic flight on Friday. A man who missed the flight told Brazilian news outlet Globo that at least 10 people were waiting at the wrong gate causing them to miss the flight.\n\n\u201cThey said to me, mister, you\u2019re not getting on this plane because we\u2019re already past the boarding limit. I even pressured them a little \u2013 \u2018mister, put me on this plane, I have to go\u2019 \u2013 then he said, \u2018There\u2019s no way, what I can do is rebook your ticket,\u2019\u201d the man told Globo.\n\nWhen they realized they were at the wrong gate, the passengers begged the airport employees to let them board the plane but were told they could not. \u201cMy legs are shaking; only God knows how I\u2019m feeling,\u201d the man said after finding out the plane had crashed. \u201cThank God, we didn\u2019t get on that plane.\u201d",

        "title": "Steph Curry is pure gold when it matters the most",
        "text": "Paris CNN \u2014\n\nStephen Curry\u2019s career highlight reel is filled with dagger three-pointers in huge moments. In just three minutes on Saturday, he added four more that might be sweeter than any of the others.\n\nAs the clock ticked down inside the final few minutes, Team USA was reeling and the French fans in the Bercy Arena were losing their minds. France had pulled within three points as the game wound down, threatening to pull out a massive upset that home nation fans were finally allowing themselves to think might actually become a reality.\n\nIn the timeout as the game got close, Curry told head coach Steve Kerrr that he wanted the ball in his hands.\n\n\u201cHe actually suggested, in the timeout with about three minutes left, he said, \u2018Let me run a clear side pick-and-roll with LeBron and we\u2019ll spread the floor,\u2019\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI said, \u2018OK, let\u2019s do that, because I\u2019ve seen this before, and it usually works out well.\u2019 And then he put on that show down the stretch in the last few minutes, and it was pretty amazing to watch.\u201d\n\nOut of that timeout, Curry got the ball at the top of the key and \u2013 bang. The US lead was back to six, and suddenly the mountain that France had to climb got just a bit taller. A points-less possession from the French and some Kevin Durant free throws stretched the lead to eight before the French cut it back to six on their next time down the floor.\n\nWith the crowd in Paris again going nuts, the noise from their voices and their drums echoing around the building, Curry again had the answer. Another three and the lead was suddenly nine with under two minutes to play.\n\nThe French answered with a three of their own, but there was no question what was coming the next time the Americans came down the floor. Off a pass from Devin Booker with 1:19 left, Curry buried another three and the US was back up by three possessions.\n\nWhat came next though was just the Steph Curry-est shot that Steph Curry has ever made.\n\nAfter Victor Wembanyama sank his own three to bring the French again within six points, Curry got the ball at the top of the key. The French defense knew what was coming \u2013 Nicolas Batum and Evan Fournier were both marking Curry, two of the team\u2019s best defenders on the greatest shooter in the world.\n\nUsually, defense wins championships. But no defense is strong enough to contain Steph Curry when he\u2019s feeling it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen it before. Got a hot player, you gotta keep firing him,\u201d Booker said to reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s the best shooter to ever live, and today was another test of that.\u201d\n\nCurry dished it to former teammate Durant and took a few steps to his right. He stopped on a dime and came back to the top of the arc to try and find some space but found Batum and Fournier once again in his face. So, instead he dribbled once behind his back, took a step backward and \u2013 while falling away, his right leg rising in to the air between Batum and Fournier \u2013 threw up a shot that was the heat check to end all heat checks.\n\nAnd, because it was Curry who shot it, it fell.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to settle us down. All we wanted to do was get a good shot. It had been a while since we had good possession,\u201d he said afterward. \u201c(Finally) the momentum was on our side. At that point, your mind goes blank. You don\u2019t really care about setting or the scenario or anything. It\u2019s just a shot.\u201d\n\nBut later, he admitted to reporters, \u201cThat impressed me, I impressed myself with that one.\u201d\n\nThe noise that erupted from the French crowd contained so many emotions that it might be hard to describe them all. Shock, incredulity, amazement, frustration, heartbreak, all wrapped together in one moment.\n\nThe noise that came from Curry was easier to understand. The best shooter of his generation ran down the court, beating his chest and screaming into the Parisian night. He held the USA on the front of his jersey out for all to see as he soaked in the moment.\n\nIt was Curry\u2019s first Olympics, and he said before the game began that he had been having more fun playing in this tournament than he had had playing basketball in a long time. And when Curry is having fun playing basketball, there\u2019s just no way to stop him. The gold medal that went around his neck Saturday night is proof.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of relief. It wasn\u2019t easy but, damn, I\u2019m excited, man,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is everything that I wanted it to be and more, so I\u2019m excited.\u201d",

        "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAlgerian boxer Imane Khelif defeated Chinese opponent Yang Liu in the 66kg gold medal bout at the Paris Summer Olympics on Friday.\n\nKhelif received a warm welcome from the crowd as she entered the ring at Roland Garros Stadium for her fourth bout of the Games. Algerian flags were seen waving all around the arena.\n\nIn the first round, both fighters started off tentatively, but Khelif got the better of her southpaw opponent, taking the round in unanimous fashion.\n\nIt was more of the same in the second round as a stiff punch from the Algerian sent Yang bouncing off the ropes in the opening seconds. With the pro-Khelif crowd chanting wildly, she punished her opponent with a barrage of punches on her way to another victorious round on all the judges\u2019 scorecards.\n\nWith a huge lead on the scorecards, Khelif continued to apply the pressure to Yang in the third and final round. The Chinese fighter continued pressing forward, but could not break through Khelif\u2019s defense.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy. For eight years, this has been my dream and I\u2019m now the Olympic champion and gold medallist,\u201d she said after the fight. \u201cI\u2019ve worked for eight years, no sleep, eight years tired. Now I\u2019m Olympic champion.\u201dI want to thank all the people who have come to support me. All the people from Algeria and all the people at my base. I want to thank all the team, my coach. Thank you so much.\u201d\n\nAfter the final bell rang, the fighters hugged in a show of respect and sportsmanship.\n\nThe crowd cheered raucously as it was announced that Khelif had won the gold medal on points by unanimous decision.\n\nKhelif did her trademark victory dance in the ring and posed for photographers before she was carried away from the ring on the shoulders of one of her trainers.\n\nKhelif had been the subject of global attention after defeating Italian boxer Angela Carini in just 46 seconds in a preliminary match.\n\nThe fight triggered an onslaught of online abuse, with transphobic commentators incorrectly calling Khelif \u201ca man\u201d because she had failed a so-called \u201cgender test\u201d by a now-discredited boxing federation that had been stripped of its ability to run the Olympic events. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) took over the sport for the 2024 Games because it decided that no international federation was qualified to run the sport and emphasized repeatedly that Khelif met the criteria to compete.\n\nIOC President Thomas Bach was asked Friday if the organization was prioritizing inclusion over safety by allowing Khelif and Lin to compete.\n\n\u201cIt is not as easy as some in this cultural war want to portray it,\u201d Bach answered. \u201cThese two are women, and they have the right to participate in the women\u2019s competition. And this has nothing to do with inclusion in any way.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in Arabic to SNTV, a sports video partner of the Associated Press, Khelif urged people earlier this week \u201cto uphold the Olympic principles, according to the Olympic charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes because this thing has effects, massive effects.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can destroy people, it can kill people\u2019s thoughts, spirit and mind,\u201d she said, adding that it was not easy to go through what followed her match with Carini.\n\nIOC spokesperson Mark Adams defended Khelif\u2019s participation the Paris 2024 Olympic Games at a press conference after the Carini fight, saying Khelif was \u201cborn female, was registered female, lived her life as a female, boxed as a female, has a female passport.\u201d\n\nThe IOC confirmed at the time that the match was \u201cnot a man fighting a woman,\u201d and that \u201cscientifically on that, there is consensus.\u201d\n\nKhelif is not the only boxer receiving added attention for her presence in Paris. Boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan is also in the spotlight after years of amateur competition.\n\nLin will fight in the women\u2019s 57kg gold medal bout on Saturday.",

        "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Delving into the archives of pop culture history, \u201cRemember When?\u201d is a CNN Style series offering a nostalgic look at the celebrity outfits that defined their eras.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nRemember when Lionel Richie, flanked by 1984\u2019s finest pyrotechnics, closed out the LA Olympic Games wearing an entirely beaded jacket?\n\nIt was one of Richie\u2019s first solo gigs after leaving funk and soul group the Commodores two years earlier. \u201cI was just getting my feet wet,\u201d he told the Associated Press in 2020. \u201cI think I had done a couple Vegas shows just to warm up, but nothing like this.\u201d He performed a memorable 9-minute rendition of \u201cAll Night Long\u201d to an estimated viewing audience of 2.6 billion, surrounded by a dancing entourage dressed in a mix of white tracksuits and red cheerleading mini dresses. As they circled around the stage, a torrent of fireworks lit up the sky.\n\nWhile he might now be associated with a more muted wardrobe, particularly his revolving stock of American Idol-approved leather jackets and black Anthony Thomas Melillo black T-shirts, Richie was once a more daring \u2014 or at least dazzling \u2014 dresser. The unforgettable blue and silver beaded jacket he wore to the 1984 Olympics was cropped at the hips, with a silver piping around the collar and sleeves. He paired the statement jacket, designed by the late Bill Frank Whitten, with white pleated trousers, a silver sequinned shirt and a matching beaded belt.\n\nThe dazzling outfit was designed by the late costumier Bill Frank Whitten, who has worked with Michael Jackson and Elton John. S&G/PA/Getty Images\n\nWhitten was the creator of many of Elton John and Michael Jackson\u2019s renowned stage looks, including Jackson\u2019s iconic single white glove, or the crystal-encrusted socks he wore the first time he moondanced to \u201cBillie Jean\u201d at a Motown concert in 1983. Whitten\u2019s flair for crystals, rhinestones and high-shine materials was subversive to many at first, after a decade ruled by sensual velvet and silk. \u201cWhen I came into the business the only man in a beaded jacket was Liberace,\u201d Whitten told the LA Times in 1990. \u201cNobody had tasty beading for men. Nobody.\u201d\n\nThe trailblazing garment is now on display for the first time at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; a museum of music memorabilia in Cleveland, Ohio, where it will sit within a new exhibition celebrating the artists of 1984 \u2014 from Tina Turner, Madonna and Bruce Springsteen to Lionel Richie.\n\nWhile the original piece might not be in Richie\u2019s possession, he has a version of it. In an interview with Coveteur magazine in 2018, the global superstar opened his closet to reveal a blue sequined bomber jacket with the words \u201cAll Night Long\u201d emblazoned across the back. \u201cIt\u2019s really a take from the 1984 Olympic jacket,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that particular time, I was launching \u2018All Night Long,\u2019 and it just happened to be at the 1984 Olympics, and of course, you just can\u2019t beat the color. We took it and made a bomber jacket out of it, and then, just to be completely camp with it, let\u2019s put \u2018All Night Long\u2019 on the back of it!\u201d\n\nOut of all the glittering medals won at the Games that year, perhaps viewers remember Richie\u2019s high-shine closing ceremony performance the most. Stood atop a shimmering gold podium in his luminous beaded jacket, it\u2019s clear Richie was also going for gold.",

        "title": "Kursk offensive: Ukraine embarrasses Putin with surprise assault on southern Russia",
        "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nVladimir Putin fixed the commander in chief of Russia\u2019s military, General Valery Gerasimov, with a cold stare and a look of exasperation. The video, released Wednesday by the Kremlin, showed the Russian president was not happy with news from the southern region of Kursk.\n\nAt that moment, hundreds of Ukrainian troops, backed by tanks and protected by air defenses, were advancing into the region. Russian soldiers were surrendering; hundreds of Russian civilians in and around the town of Sudzha were fleeing with anything they could grab.\n\nIn two-and-a-half years of warfare, it was an unprecedented Ukrainian incursion into Russia. Putin told the Kremlin meeting that it was \u201canother major provocation\u201d by Kyiv. The region\u2019s acting governor declared a state of emergency, describing the situation as \u201cvery difficult.\u201d\n\nAbove all, it was humiliating for a Russian state that prides itself on protecting the motherland.\n\nThe Kursk attack was an audacious and counter-intuitive move from the Ukrainian military, what one analyst describes as \u201cdoing the least obvious thing.\u201d\n\nDespite steadily losing ground in eastern Donetsk, it chose to send elements of experienced brigades into Russian territory, with the apparent goals of embarrassing the Kremlin and forcing the Russian Defense Ministry to redeploy resources and providing the home front with a much-needed morale boost.\n\nGeorge Barros at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War says the Ukrainians \u201cachieved operational surprise against great odds and are currently exploiting Russia\u2019s lack of readiness in its border areas.\u201d (The same tactic worked in September 2022 when they recovered much of occupied Kharkiv region within a week.)\n\nThe Russian regiment tasked with defending this part of the border abandoned its positions. Several dozen soldiers were taken captive, leading President Volodymyr Zelensky to express Friday \u201cspecial gratitude to our warriors and units who are replenishing the \u2018exchange fund\u2019 \u2013 by taking the occupiers as captives and thus helping to free our people from Russian captivity.\u201d\n\nA column of Russian reinforcements was taken out by a missile attack near the town of Rylsk on Thursday night, possibly because the Ukrainians had managed to hack into multiple traffic cameras that are a feature of Russian highways. One Russian blogger, Aleksander Kots, said he had driven the route. \u201cI noticed that there are cameras working along the entire highway. They are literally blinking their lights.\u201d\n\nMeeting little resistance, and with Russian communications in the region reportedly jammed by effective electronic warfare, the Ukrainian brigades pushed more than 20 kilometers (12 miles)\ufeff inside Kursk in the first two days of the operation.\n\nGood intelligence allowed advanced units to move still further forward in a somewhat chaotic battlefield, often bypassing Russian defenses. By Friday Russian authorities had lost control over at least 250 square kilometers of territory, according to several independent analyses and CNN\u2019s mapping.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just a patch of empty Russian countryside. Among the places that came under Ukrainian control was a natural gas transit hub near the border through which Russia supplies Europe with substantial volumes of natural gas.\n\nOn Friday, a Ukrainian military Telegram channel declared the facility \u201cunder the control of the 99th mechanised battalion of the 61st Mechanized Brigade,\u201d one of the experienced units involved in the assault. A video showed soldiers in front of the building, but Gazprom said Saturday that the pipeline was still operating.\n\nInside Russia, the sort of anger that had greeted setbacks at the beginning of the war was rekindled.\n\nAndrey Gurulyov, a former commander in the region, reposted a comment on Telegram that demanded military prosecutors investigate decisions by commanders to transfer units from the Kursk region ahead of the attack.\n\nAnd there was resentment amongst Russian civilians in the region, thousands of whom fled their homes. The head of the city of Rylsk \u2013 some distance from the most advanced Ukrainian units \u2013 said Friday more than half the population of 15,000 had left. Social media videos illustrated the frustration among civilians at the sluggish response of the military; some appealed directly to President Putin.\n\nAn expeditionary force\n\nUkrainian troops, even if reinforced, cannot expect to occupy several hundred square kilometers of Russian territory. This is very much an expeditionary force, albeit a battle-hardened one, that has exploited the absence of organized resistance to make ground quickly.\n\nBut holding a large chunk Russian territory is beyond their capacity and probably beyond their goal. Russian reinforcements will eventually make their mark, even if it takes them longer than three days to begin effective defense. On Saturday, the Russian Defense Ministry said units had \u201cthwarted the attempts of the enemy\u2019s mobile groups to get to the depth\u201d of Russian territory near Ivashkovsky, Malaya Loknya, and Olgovka in the Kursk region. Olgovka is 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) from the border.\n\nThere were also signs Saturday that Russian \u201cLancet\u201d drones were beginning to degrade Ukrainian armour.\n\nEmil Kastehelmi at the Black Bird group in Finland, which uses open-source intelligence to track the conflict says \u201ctime is running against Ukrainians \u2013 (the) Russians won\u2019t be disorganized forever.\u201d\n\nEven if the Ukrainians need to pull back from more advanced positions, such an operation still serves several purposes. Barros says it \u201cexposes some of Russia\u2019s planning assumptions and critical vulnerabilities.\u201d And Matthew Schmidt, who has taught strategic and operational planning at the US Army\u2019s Command and General Staff College, said the Ukrainians\u2019 \u201ccreative use of force was designed to put pressure on the decision-makers in Moscow\u201d \u2013 and possibly cost some of them their jobs.\n\nRussian military blogger Vladislav Shurygin crystallized all this in a Telegram post Friday, saying that the enemy had \u201cvery skilfully and accurately chosen a different strategy - taking advantage of the bureaucratic rigidity and sluggishness of the Russian management system, to exhaust Russia with continuous unexpected strikes on sensitive infrastructure and the civilian population, provoking discontent, disappointment and apathy.\u201d\n\nA view of a building on fire in the town of Sudzha following an incursion of Ukrainian troops into the Kursk region, Russia, in this still image from video taken August 7. Mic Izvestia/IZ.RU/Reuters\n\nThe Kursk operation also demonstrates to Ukraine\u2019s allies that it still has the energy and imagination to surprise its enemy and embarrass the Kremlin at a time when much of the news from the frontline was bleak for Kyiv.\n\nThat\u2019s not lost on Shurygin. \u201cThe goal of this new strategy is to put Russia before the prospect of an increasingly costly war (financially, reputationally and organizationally) and to force it to negotiate peace by November-December.\u201d\n\nDaniel Fried at the Atlantic Council says there is a long history of such surprise military raids \u2013 some inconsequential and others impactful. He recalls George Washington\u2019s daring maneuver to cross the Delaware River in 1776, when he returned with captured prisoners and supplies and raised morale for the fight against the British.\n\nFried, a former US assistant secretary of state for Europe, says that by demonstrating Russia\u2019s failure of intelligence and weakness along its border, the raid had punctured the Kremlin\u2019s narrative \u201cthat Ukrainian resistance is useless and support for Ukraine is futile.\u201d\n\nUkraine\u2019s Kursk gambit forces the Russian Defense Ministry into some tough choices. It appears that existing groups in Kursk such as the National Guard, FSB and irregular elements are unable to combat the Ukrainians.\n\nBarros told CNN that the military command may redeploy elements of the recently created Northern Grouping but the redeployment of significant elements \u201cwould likely further stretch these elements and create vulnerabilities in Russian defenses elsewhere along the border.\u201d\n\nAlternatively, it may call on Russia\u2019s substantial reserves in a larger-scale operation \u2013 but these are critical for current Russian offensive operations inside Ukraine, where the continuous commitment of high numbers of troops has eroded Ukrainian defenses.\n\nOr, Barros says, the Russians may turn to aviation to attack Ukrainian armor inside Kursk, thereby preventing Ukrainian forces from consolidating positions and assisting current Russian forces deployed in the area.\n\nWhatever combination the Russians choose, they are trying to reverse a humiliating episode in the conflict just as sheer mass and air superiority in eastern Donetsk was beginning to deliver incremental progress, underpinning the Kremlin\u2019s insistence that Ukraine give up four eastern regions as a condition for negotiations.\n\n\u201cThe unfolding events demonstrate the extent to which Moscow has deeply depended on sanctuary in Russian territory to wage its war against Ukraine,\u201d Barros told CNN. \u201cRussia has undermanned its borders and border fortifications, relying on its perception of safety because it has not felt vulnerable.\u201d\n\nAcross a southern border with Ukraine that is hundreds of miles long, that perception has been seriously, and unexpectedly, challenged.\n\nDarya Tarasova and Maria Kostenko contributed reporting to this story.",

        "title": "US to South Korea: TikTok star undergoes 15 beauty treatments in just 3 days",
        "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAt the beginning of the year, Yerim Lee landed in Seoul, South Korea with the intention of spending around a week there with her extended family \u2014 and undertaking a serious, fast-tracked regime of beauty treatments.\n\nLee said she got 15 services done in the span of three days during her trip, sharing the list in a TikTok video from her account, @taxinoodle, that now has over 1.2 million views.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Seoul has become a global beauty capital in recent years, known for its focus on skincare and makeup, as well as its famous plastic surgery clinics. But non- or minimally- invasive procedures have also become a popular way to achieve a seemingly-flawless natural look, emphasizing delicate, hyper-feminine features, glowy skin and glossy hair.\n\n\u201cA lot of women will get these treatments done every few weeks (for) their nails or their hair,\u201d said Lee, referencing the regular upkeep of salon manicures, body waxing and blowouts \u2014 some of which have flourished into billion-dollar industries in South Korea. \u201cThese procedures have been around for so long.\u201d\n\nAs the goalposts for what is considered beautiful continue to shift, cosmetic injectables and the type of treatments she underwent are also increasingly routine, she added.\n\nLee, who was raised in South Korea until the age of 11 and is now based in New York City, began getting beauty treatments in the US. \u201cNow that I\u2019m in my mid-20s\u2026 I started getting a little Botox here and there, but I prefer to do it in Korea because the price is unbeatable,\u201d she said. She flies back regularly to get small touch-ups, but had never gone back for this many in one go until this year.\n\n\u201cThe price benefit \u2014 you can\u2019t ignore that,\u201d Lee said. \u201cGetting a plane ticket to Korea to get Botox and filler done is honestly cheaper than getting it done here.\u201d\n\nLee undergoes a beauty treatment in South Korea. This one came with an emotional support plushie. Courtesy _Lee @taxinoodle_\n\nA screenshot from Lee's TikTok video where she explains the 15 beauty treatments she had done in Seoul. _Lee @taxinoodle_/TikTok\n\nWhile the added costs of a plane ticket and hotel stay may not be cheaper than getting a single appointment at home, the savings can rack up over multiple treatments. Botox for Lee\u2019s forehead, jaw and eyebrows ran her about $70 in Seoul, for example. The same amount of Botox would ring in anywhere from $500 to $1,400 in New York City.\n\nFor some, there\u2019s the benefit of being able to travel while also getting these cheaper treatments done; in the creator economy, there\u2019s also value (think monetized videos) in sharing such journeys on social media. Influencers offer tips on the best treatments to book when you only have a few days in the country or film their \u201cglow-up days,\u201d beating a constant refrain of affordability and innovative technologies. \u201cDid u even go to Korea if u didn\u2019t get a facial,\u201d one TikTok user captioned their glow-up vlog.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more common, and kind of like a trend, to talk openly in Korea about what procedures you get and share tips,\u201d Lee added. Due to South Korea\u2019s strict advertising laws, clinics often rely on word of mouth, so Lee leaned on friends and family for recommendations. \u201cBeauty scams are also really common,\u201d she added. \u201cSo that can make it harder for people who are visiting or don\u2019t speak the language.\u201d\n\nLee is currently developing a website and database to provide tips and resources for people interested in traveling to South Korea for K-beauty treatments, in order to help non-Korean speakers.\n\nVisitors and vendors discuss beauty products at the K-Beauty Expo, the largest beauty exhibition in South Korea, on October 12, 2023 in Goyang, South Korea. Chris Jung/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nMedical and beauty tourism is a major source of revenue for the country. Last year, the South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare announced it will ease immigration procedures for tourists coming to the country for medical purposes, including cosmetic surgeries, aiming to attract 700,000 medical tourists by 2027. Last month, the ministry announced that the number of tourists who visited South Korea for cosmetic procedures reached an all-time high of 605,768 in 2023 \u2014 a 144.2% increase from the previous year.\n\nDon\u2019t be led by low prices alone, do your research\n\nThis means that the available products and services are expanding \u2014 and can even be \u201coverwhelming,\u201d Lee noted, though the competition has helped push down prices. Lee\u2019s procedures ran as low as $19. That said, consumers should be wary of very cheap treatments. Vendors are split broadly into two categories, she said: factory clinics and boutique clinics. \u201c(At) factory clinics, you don\u2019t see a doctor \u2014 you know exactly what you\u2019re there for,\u201d she explained. You can be in and out in 10 minutes\u2026 It\u2019s for people who know what they\u2019re doing, and these clinics are a lot cheaper.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor travelers or first-timers, I would avoid them,\u201d she added. \u201cYou should be doing your research and you should sit down with a doctor who can tell you what you should be looking for.\u201d\n\nLee said when she went to boutique clinics, however, she was able to speak with a medical professional ahead of each procedure, learning what exactly the injectable or laser or treatments would do to her body and getting a more in-depth walkthrough of what to expect for the procedure and healing process. Many boutique clinics, she noticed, also had better options for non-Korean speakers.\n\nA K-beauty odyssey, for the social media age\n\nLee visited six different clinics, the majority located in Seoul\u2019s Gangnam neighborhood, which has long been known for its wealthy residents and emphasis on beauty (and, of course, was the inspiration behind K-pop star Psy\u2019s viral 2012 hit, \u201cGangnam Style\u201d). \u201cEvery ad and billboard you see will be for a plastic surgery clinic or something like that,\u201d Lee said of the area. The term \u201cGangnam unnie\u201d (Gangnam sister) emerged years ago to describe bandaged patients \u2014 those who had more drastic procedures done \u2014 coming out of one of the district\u2019s many plastic surgery clinics. It has since become a derogatory term, \u201clike, you look fake and plastic,\u201d Lee explained.\n\nShe started with an appointment to have her eyebrows microbladed ($225), before visiting a vision center to have her irises measured. (The service, offered to Lee for free, is done to help consumers purchase the right size of colored lenses.)\n\nOn her next stop, Lee was put under general anesthesia to undergo a series of treatments at a plastic surgery clinic. This was her most intensive visit, she said \u2014 figuring she may as well make the most of being put under. All of the procedures targeted her face: three kinds of collagen-promoting \u201cskin booster\u201d injectables, including Juvelook (one vial, $400), Juvelook Volume (two vials, $830) and Rejuran Healer (one vial, $330); Botox ($70) in her forehead, jaw, and between the eyebrows; CO2 lasers ($8) that zapped off moles on her face and neck; and 600 shots of Ultherapy ($1,275), an ultrasound treatment that is intended to stimulate collagen production and define features.\n\nYerim Lee undergoes a microblading treatment at a clinic in Seoul, South Korea. Courtesy _Lee @taxinoodle_\n\n\u201cUltherapy is well known to be the most expensive and effective procedure, as well as the most painful one,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what left me with the most bruising and swelling after. I know some people get it done without going under, and I always see videos of people crying. They give you a very fluffy plushie to hang onto.\u201d\n\nAt a second plastic surgery clinic, Lee got a few more procedures focused on her body, including Botox in her trapezius muscle, known as Traptox ($300), to get that \u201cJennie (Kim) shoulder look,\u201d Lee said, referencing the Blackpink star\u2019s coveted angular shoulders. She was also given fat dissolving shots ($150) in her arms \u2014 a procedure often called lipolysis in the US \u2014 and a Body InMode treatment ($600), which uses heat and radio frequency to remodel tissue for a tightened look. She had a few more moles lasered off with CO2 ($11) to round out the day.\n\nAt a third clinic, Lee received an additional InMode treatment focused on her chin, as well as additional fat-dissolving shots \u2014 aiming to achieve the tapered V-line face shape that has become a K-beauty standard. These treatments would normally cost $30 and $34 respectively, but Lee was offered them for free in exchange for potentially covering the experience on TikTok.\n\n\u201cMy bruising lasted a whole two weeks, and swelling didn\u2019t go down for three weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say what one thing had the biggest effect on my face, though, because I got them all done at once. But there\u2019s definitely a difference.\u201d\n\nLee pictured during a consultation in Seoul. _Lee @taxinoodle_\n\nYerim Lee undergoes a beauty treatment. Courtesy _Lee @taxinoodle_\n\nLee receives a consultation \u2014 and the requisite \"before\" shots to compare with post-treatment ones \u2014 at a clinic in South Korea. Courtesy _Lee @taxinoodle_\n\nLee always gets her hair dyed ($125) in South Korea because she prefers the pricing and service. On this trip, she received a personalized \u201cstem cell scalp\u201d treatment ($190), and on TikTok claimed that light therapy given as part of the service helped to improve blood circulation, while various other techniques were used to reduce scalp buildup. Several Seoul-based clinics have gone viral on TikTok for using AI and other high-tech accessories to examine scalp health and address hair issues.\n\nLessons learned\n\nThe total cost for all of her procedures came out to $4,578. While the entire experience might seem like a lot, which is partly why she was inspired to post about it, Lee said she was happy with her services. But she emphasized that her satisfaction was partly due to the amount of homework she did beforehand to figure out which clinics were reputable and best suited to her needs. \u201cIt\u2019s easier if you speak Korean,\u201d she admitted, as many of the deals she found were through word-of-mouth or Korean social media apps.\n\nThose looking to undergo treatments \u2014 at home or abroad \u2014 should conduct thorough research and be aware of issues such as scams, product safety and a clinic\u2019s practices and reputation.\n\nIn a follow-up video on TikTok, Lee listed five things she would have done differently during her trip to Seoul, such as allowing for more recovery time and better understanding procedures\u2019 side effects (her skin \u201cswelled so much\u201d after skin boosters that she was scared she was having an allergic reaction). In hindsight, Lee said she should have gotten everything done by one doctor, who could then advise on the optimal order of procedures, rather than at various clinics. (She spread the procedures out across multiple clinics for her own research purposes).\n\nLee said she doesn\u2019t judge people who undergo procedures to fit certain beauty standards. \u201cI want to shine a light on this side of beauty,\u201d she explained. \u201cEven just scrolling through TikTok, so many fans of Korean stars will swear, \u2018I know she didn\u2019t get anything done like other people,\u2019 but this area of non-plastic surgery treatments is just so common. It\u2019s not a bad or good thing, it\u2019s just so ingrained in the culture.\u201d",

[ Return to card summary ]\n\nHow to choose a credit card based on its intro bonus\n\nA credit card's welcome bonus is often the most valuable benefit. However, it's only a one-time perk, so you'll want to carefully consider everything else the card offers before applying. As you're analyzing intro bonus offers, it's important to pay attention to two factors: Bonus value and requirements. Bonus value For certain types of cards, it's simple to estimate the bonus value. For example, a cash bonus of $500 is worth $500, but how much are 50,000 points or miles worth? The answer depends on the type of rewards and how you intend to use them. If you want to earn hotel points or airline miles, you can only redeem those points within that program, which limits your options. However, when you earn transferrable points, you typically can move those rewards to many different airlines or hotels. This added flexibility can increase the value of flexible rewards, so 50,000 transferrable points are generally worth more than 50,000 hotel points. Bonus requirements If you're approved for a card, you'll still need to meet the spending requirement before you're awarded any bonus points, miles or cash. To ensure you can hit the spending threshold without overspending, look at your credit card statement for the past few months or the year. This should give you a good idea of how much you can expect to spend on your new card. If you usually spend $1,500 on your credit card(s) each month, then any card with a spending requirement of $4,500 or less within three months should be achievable for you. You can also plan your credit card application around bigger, but less frequent expenses. If you're paying your annual insurance premiums or booking lodging for your yearly vacation, it might make sense to apply for a card beforehand.\n\nCredit card welcome bonus pros and cons\n\nCard credit intro bonuses can help you collect loads of miles, points or other rewards. However, these are one-time bonuses, and you need to look at a card's benefits and perks to get the full picture of whether it's a worthy addition to your wallet. Welcome bonuses also typically have spending requirements that need to be met within a certain timeframe and these requirements aren't always easy to meet. Pros Welcome bonuses can be exceptionally valuable, even when you factor in the spending requirement. The best offers may provide 10X to 20X points per dollar on the spending you need to make to earn the bonus.\n\nIntro bonuses allow you to quickly earn enough rewards to book more valuable redemptions, such as business-class flights or luxury hotels that typically have higher point or mile requirements. Cons A card's welcome bonus could entice you to spend more than you otherwise would have. In this scenario, you may end up paying interest if you can't afford to pay off the balance.\n\nIntro bonuses are one-off card benefits, so you need to make sure the card's ongoing perks are worth it or offset the annual fee (if there is one).\n\nFAQs What is a credit card sign-up bonus? A credit card sign-up bonus is an incentive to entice consumers to open a new credit card and make purchases with the card. You typically need to spend a certain amount within a specified period of time to earn the bonus. How do credit card sign-up bonuses work? Credit card sign-up bonuses are typically one-time offers you can qualify for when you open a new card. These rewards often come in the form of cashback, points or miles, and generally require spending a certain amount of money with that card within the first few months of account opening. The spending thresholds vary but generally range from $500 to $5,000. Are credit card sign-up bonus offers worth it? Credit card sign-up bonuses can be worth it as they can add hundreds of dollars (or sometimes even over a thousand dollars) back to your wallet and are generally non-taxable since you had to spend money to earn them. However, you should only pursue a welcome bonus if you can meet the spending requirement without overspending or stretching yourself too thin. You don't want to carry a balance just to earn a bonus since the interest charges could outweigh the value of any rewards you earn. How many credit card sign-up bonuses can you earn? Some card issuers like American Express limit the number of sign-up bonuses you can earn for a card to once per lifetime, while others may allow you to earn a sign-up bonus multiple times, but may make you wait a certain period of time before being eligible again. What sign-up bonuses are the easiest to get? Cashback cards like the Wells Fargo Active Cash Card and the Capital One SavorOne Cash Rewards Credit Card generally have sign-up bonuses that are easier to earn. What is the best credit card sign-up bonus? While the best credit card sign-up bonus will depend on the individual, travel rewards cards like the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card, Chase Sapphire Preferred Card and The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express currently offer some of the largest welcome bonuses.\n\nSubscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!

See our methodology for more information on how we choose the best credit card sign-up bonuses.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo determine which cards offer the best value, CNBC Select analyzed over 250 major credit cards issued through FDIC-insured banks and NCUA-insured credit unions that are widely available in the U.S. and offer welcome bonuses. We compared each card on a range of features, including rewards (e.g., cash back, points and miles), annual fees, welcome bonuses, introductory and standard APR and balance transfer fees and foreign transaction fees. We also considered additional perks (e.g., ongoing travel or merchant statement credits), cardholder protections (e.g., purchase protection, $0 liability protection and travel insurance), the application process when available (e.g., is there a credit pull or required credit score) and how easy it is to redeem points (e.g., are rewards are tied to a specific brand; if transferable, to how many/which partners, can you redeem for straight cash back).\n\n\n\nWe also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools. For the cards that offered a rewards program, we considered consumer spending data forecasts from location intelligence firm Esri to determine where U.S. consumers are spending the most money, like on dining and travel. We used this to help determine what bonus categories are most useful for consumers. Since the value of a point or mile varies based on what they can be redeemed for, we also considered things like transferability and the ability to redeem for cash-back.

Know what cards you're eligible for Your credit score goes a long way in determining what cards you can qualify for. If you're looking to boost your credit score from average to excellent to increase your approval odds for a home loan, an unsecured credit card could work for you. Credit cards for average credit may also have rewards and other benefits for you to take advantage of. If you're new to credit or recovering from bankruptcy, you may need to start with a secured credit card. Some credit cards offer pre-approval or pre-qualification, which doesn't guarantee you'll be approved for a card, but it can save you from applying for a card you're likely to be rejected for. In some situations, it may make sense to apply for a card issued by the bank where you have checking or savings accounts because that could boost your approval odds. Understand what matters when building credit By making on-time payments, credit cards allow you to slowly rebuild your credit score or fill out your personal credit report. When you keep your credit card balance low, or ideally, pay it off fully each month, this also helps boost your credit score. So building good financial habits is more important than finding the most rewarding credit card. When you want to use a credit card to establish your credit history, think of rewards as icing on the cake. Don't look for lucrative welcome bonuses or overspending to earn rewards on unlock benefits.\n\nHow to build credit with a credit card\n\nThere are different types of credit scoring models, such as FICO Score and VantageScore, but the most popular scores use the information found on your credit report. They typically use the information available from the three major credit reporting bureaus: Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. By opening a credit card, you're adding to your credit profile. However, how you use the credit card is what matters the most. Pay your monthly bill on time Your payment history is a huge part of your credit score. So it's important to pay your credit card bill on time and consistently. As these payments are documented in your credit report, your credit score is more likely to improve over time. Keep your balance low Your total debt also factors heavily into how your credit score is calculated. Having less debt and using a smaller percentage of your available credit (keeping a low credit utilization ratio) will have a positive impact on your credit score. This makes having a budget in place an important part of building credit. It can be easy to overspend with a credit card and if you find yourself in this situation, it could hurt your credit instead of help it.\n\nTypes of cards to look for if you want to build credit\n\nRewards and travel benefits shouldn't be the priority when building credit. Rather, you should use a credit-building card to establish responsible credit habits. Once you're in a situation where you can consistently pay off your credit cards in full and on time, then you're ready to consider credit cards with larger welcome bonuses and useful benefits. Secured credit cards Secured credit cards require an upfront deposit and your credit limit is based on that deposit. Secured credit cards like the Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card are less risky for card issuers and you can possibly qualify for secured cards with no credit history or if you have a weak credit score. Unsecured credit cards do not require a security deposit and have a credit limit based on your income, credit history and other factors. There are unsecured credit cards available to those with average or fair credit, but in general, if you have no credit or bad credit, an unsecured credit card will be your best option for moving your credit score forward. Student credit cards If you're interested in opening your first credit card, are over 18 years old and are enrolled in an eligible college, consider a student credit card like the Discover it\u00ae Student Cash Back. These cards are designed with students in mind and are often available even if you don't have a credit history. Many of these cards also don't require a security deposit and some even offer rewards.\n\nWhat does it mean to build your credit?\n\nYour credit score is based on the information in your credit report. To build your credit you need activity, like credit card and loan payments, to be reported to credit bureaus. Your credit score is generally based on factors such as payment history, the age of your accounts and total debt. When you open a credit card and pay the balance on time consistently, this improves your credit score and is a signal to creditors that you're a reliable borrower. However, having a credit card can work both ways. If you miss payments or are late paying, that harms your credit score. Also, if you pay on time, but accumulate debt that can hurt your credit score. Overall, the best way to build credit is to have a long history of positive activity (i.e. paying on time) with creditors such as banks and credit unions.\n\nTips for building credit\n\nThere's no set formula for building credit. Instead, your habits, over time, will move your credit score in one direction or another. However, there are a few tips that can help you get things headed in the right direction. Understand how credit scores work Knowing what goes into your credit score is key to building a healthy credit profile. While there are multiple types of credit scores, the most popular credit scoring models are largely based on factors such as: Payment history\n\nDebt\n\nTypes of credit\n\nAge of accounts Each of these factors are weighted differently, and your payment history and debt typically are more important. It's important to develop the habit of paying bills on time and creating a plan to stay out of debt or pay down your existing debt if you want to improve your credit score. Get added as an authorized user If your lack of credit history is preventing you from getting approved for a credit card or a car loan, it might make sense to get added as an authorized user on someone else's account. When you're added as an authorized user, the credit history of that account could be added to your credit report. This can be a double-edged sword, so it only makes sense to go this route with someone with a history of paying their credit cards on time and in full. Monitor your credit A credit monitoring service can help you maintain an error-free credit report by alerting you when anything changes on your credit report. There are free credit monitoring services that are useful, but if you want to cover all the credit bureaus you may want to opt for a more robust paid service.

Building a good credit score is necessary for many major financial moves, including taking out a mortgage, opening a credit card, getting car insurance and sometimes even landing your dream job. If you don't have a good or excellent credit score, you may not get approved for a certain financial product or may pay higher interest rates. What are the benefits of building credit? Building credit has many benefits because nearly every facet of your financial life is impacted by the strength of your credit score. Building a good credit score helps improve your approval odds for financial products, helps you qualify for lower interest rates and better terms and allows you to to benefit from robust credit card benefits. Can I get approved for a credit card with no credit history? It is possible to sign up for a credit card without having a credit history. It's generally easier to get approved for secured credit cards or starter credit cards, which are designed especially for those who are beginning to build their credit. How do I improve my credit score? The best way to improve your credit score is by consistently practicing responsible credit behavior, such as paying your bills on time every month and limiting your credit utilization ratio. Do authorized users build credit? Becoming an authorized user on someone else's credit card is a great way to build credit. So long as the primary cardholder has good (670 to 799) or excellent credit (800 to 850), it can be relatively low-risk and allows you to build or boost your credit score. However, there are also instances where being an authorized user can harm your credit score, such as if the primary account holder misses a payment.\n\nWhy trust CNBC Select?\n\nAt CNBC Select, our mission is to provide our readers with high-quality service journalism and comprehensive consumer advice so they can make informed decisions with their money.

We also considered additional perks (e.g., ongoing travel or merchant statement credits), cardholder protections (e.g., purchase protection, $0 liability protection and travel insurance), the application process when available (e.g., is there a credit pull or required credit score) and how easy it is to redeem points (e.g., are rewards are tied to a specific brand; if transferable, to how many/which partners, can you redeem for straight cash back).\n\n\n\nWe also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools. For the cards that offered a rewards program, we considered consumer spending data forecasts from location intelligence firm Esri to determine where U.S. consumers are spending the most money, like on dining and travel. We used this to help determine what bonus categories are most useful for consumers. Since the value of a point or mile varies based on what they can be redeemed for, we also considered things like transferability and the ability to redeem for cash-back. When choosing the best credit cards for rebuilding credit, we focused on cards that are available to consumers with lower credit scores or those with no credit history. While rewards and other benefits were also factored into our decisions, these were secondary considerations.

Simply put, you take out a new loan to pay off old debt, then pay back the new debt according to agreed-upon terms. It makes sense to refinance if you can't afford your current bill payments and need to find a lower monthly plan, or if your credit score is good enough to qualify you for a lower APR, which makes paying off the debt cheaper. For example, say you have a $10,000 balance on your credit card that charges interest at a rate of 24.99% APR. Assuming you can afford to make $400 monthly payments, it would take about three years to pay your balance off entirely. You'll also pay about $4,000 in interest, according to Experian's debt payoff calculator. On the other hand, transferring that debt to a personal loan with a 9% APR, can save you more than $3,000. Experian's calculator estimates with the same monthly payment ($400) and the lower APR, you can pay off the balance in 22 months and only pay $875 in interest charges overall. When you apply for a personal loan, you should consider the APR and the loan's term, or the length of time it will take you to pay it off. Make sure the monthly loan repayment amount fits into your budget, so you're able to comfortably pay off the loan and get your debt under control.\n\nCan debt refinancing hurt your credit score?\n\nAt its best, debt refinancing can boost your credit score by making your monthly payments more affordable and motivating you to pay off your balances. But they aren't entirely risk-free. Personal loan applications require a credit check, so you'll want to make sure you know your credit score before you apply. There's no direct penalty for getting denied a loan, but having too many applications on your credit record could be a red flag to future lenders. For debt refinancing to work, you have to \"plan your work and work your plan,\" so to speak. It helps to be honest about your money habits and the overall state of your personal finances before taking on any loan. Personal loans deliver cash directly to your bank account, making it easy to stay in debt if you're not careful. If you have concerns, opt for a loan that pays your creditors directly so that there's no opportunity for you to overspend. And before you agree to a new loan, make sure you have room in your budget to pay it back on time and in full according to the terms. A late payment on your personal loan can hurt your credit score just like if you miss a credit card bill.\n\nWhat is a good interest rate on a personal loan?\n\nMost personal loans come with fixed-rate APRs, so your monthly payment stays the same for the loan's lifetime. In a few cases, you can take out a variable-rate personal loan. If you go that route, make sure you're comfortable with your monthly payments changing if rates go up or down. Personal loan APRs average 9.65%, according to the Fed's most recent data. Meanwhile, the average credit card interest rate is around 16.28%. When considering whether to invest or pay off debt, consider that the average rate of return in the stock market tends to be above 5% when adjusted for inflation. So if you can find a personal loan with interest rates would be below 5%, you can slowly pay off your debt while also investing because you know your investments could still earn more than you're paying in interest. However, it's not always easy to qualify for personal loans with interest rates lower than 5% APR. Your interest rate will be decided based on your credit score, credit history and income, as well as other factors like the loan's size and term. See if you're pre-approved for a personal loan offer.\n\nHow do personal loans work?\n\nOnce you're approved for a personal loan, the cash is usually delivered directly to your checking account. However, if you opt for a debt consolidation/refinancing loan, you can sometimes have your lender pay your credit card accounts directly. Any extra cash leftover will be deposited into your bank account or returned to the lender. Most loan terms range anywhere from six months to seven years. The longer the term, the lower your monthly payments will be, but they usually also have higher interest rates. It's best to elect for the shortest term you can afford. When deciding on a loan term, consider how much you will end up paying in interest overall. Your monthly loan bill will include your installment payment plus interest charges. If you think you may want to pay off the loan earlier than planned, be sure to check if the lender charges an early payoff or prepayment penalty. Sometimes lenders charge a fee if you make extra payments to pay your debt down quicker, since they are losing out on that prospective interest. The fee could be a flat rate, a percentage of your loan amount or the rest of the interest you would have owed them. Once you receive the money from your loan, you have to pay back the lender in monthly installments, usually starting within 30 days. When your personal loan is paid off, the credit line is closed and you no longer have access to it.\n\nHow is my personal loan rate decided?\n\nAs you shop for a low-interest loan or credit card, remember that banks are looking for reliable borrowers who make timely payments. Financial institutions will look at your credit score, income, payment history and, in some cases, cash reserves when deciding what APR to give you. To get approved for any kind of credit product (credit card, loan, mortgage, etc.), you'll first submit an application and agree to let the lender pull your credit report. This helps lenders understand how much debt you owe, what your current monthly payments are and how much additional debt you have the capacity to take on. Once you submit your application, you may be approved for a variety of loan options. Each will have a different length of time to pay the loan back (your term) and a different interest rate. Your interest rate will be decided based on your credit score, credit history and income, as well as other factors like the loan's size and term. Generally, loans with longer terms have higher interest rates than loans you bay back over a shorter period of time.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo determine which personal loans are the best for refinancing debt, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions. When possible we chose loans with no origination or sign-up fees, but we also included options for borrowers with lower credit scores on this list. Some of those options have origination fees. When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n\nVariable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan.

Creditor payment limits and loan sizes: The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $1,000 to $100,000. Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. Note that the rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more. *Your LightStream loan terms, including APR, may differ based on loan purpose, amount, term length, and your credit profile.

Not all applicants are approved. Loan approval and actual loan terms depend on applicant's state of residence and ability to meet OneMain Financial credit standards such as a responsible credit history, sufficient income after monthly expenses, and if applicable, availability of eligible collateral. Not all approved applicants qualify for larger loan amounts, lower APRs, or the most favorable loan terms. For example, larger loan amounts typically require a first lien on a motor vehicle that is no more than ten years old, meets our value requirements, and is titled in applicant's name with valid insurance. APRs are generally higher on loans not secured by a vehicle. Example Loan: A $6,000 loan with a 24.99% APR that is repayable in 60 monthly installments would have monthly payments of $176.07. OneMain charges origination fees allowed by law. Depending on the state where the loan is opened, the origination fee may be either a flat amount or a percentage of the loan amount. Flat fees vary by state, ranging from $25 to $500. Percentage-based fees vary by state, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan amount subject to certain state limits on the fee amount. For information about these fees and minimum and maximum loan sizes available in certain states, visit omf.com/loanfees.

Another pro to using this lender is that LightStream doesn't charge any origination, administration or early payoff fees. Eligible borrowers Good to excellent credit needed Loan amounts $5,000 to $100,000 Loan terms 24 to 144 months [ Return to account summary ]\n\nSoFi\n\nSoFi Personal Loans are available from $5,000 to as much as $100,000, which makes them a great option for those who need more money to cover bigger expenses. Plus, SoFi personal loans do not require origination fees. SoFi offers a 0.25% interest rate reduction for signing up for autopay. There's also some more flexibility when it comes to choosing the type of interest rate you receive. Loan applicants can choose between variable and fixed APR. Fixed APRs give you one rate that you pay for the entirety of your loan, and variable interest rates fluctuate, but SoFi caps them at 29.99%. Eligible borrowers Must reside in a state where SoFi is authorized to lend and must be employed, have sufficient income from other sources, or have an offer of employment to start within the next 90 days. Loan amounts $5,000 to $100,000 Loan terms 24 to 84 months [ Return to account summary ]\n\nPenFed\n\nPenFed is a federal credit union that provides many personal loan options for debt consolidation, home improvement, medical expenses, auto financing and more. You don't need to be a member to apply, but you will need to sign up for a PenFed membership and keep $5 in a qualifying savings account to receive your funds. It offers personal loans as small as $600 which makes it a great option for those who don't need higher amounts of financing. Eligible borrowers While it's not required to be a PenFed member to apply, a membership will be created for you if you decide to accept the loan. Loan amounts $600 to $50,000 Loan terms 1 to 5 years [ Return to account summary ]\n\nAvant\n\nAvant stands out for considering applicants with credit scores under 600, but keep in mind that the higher your credit score, the more likely you are to receive the lowest rates. Before you decide to apply for this loan, you can see if you pre-qualify for a rate that's on the lower end of the APR range. While there are no penalties for early payoff, there is an origination fee of up to 4.75% and a late fee of up to $25 after the 10-day grace period. Eligible borrowers Applicants must have a personal checking or savings account on file Loan amounts $2,000 to $35,000 Loan terms 24 to 60 months [ Return to account summary ]\n\nOneMain Financial\n\nOneMain Financial offers personal loan options that are a little more flexible compared to other lenders.

Plus, borrowers can choose the date their monthly payments are due and have the option to apply with a co-applicant. OneMain Financial has an origination fee that's on the higher end: either a fixed fee between $25 and $500 or up to 10% of the loan amount, depending on which state you live in. While there aren't any penalties for paying off the loan early, there is a late fee that will run you $30 or up to 15% (depending on your state). Eligible borrowers Applicants must submit proof of income and proof of residence to be considered Loan amounts $1,500 to $20,000 Loan terms 24, 36, 48, 60 Months [ Return to account summary ]\n\nProsper\n\nProsper allows co-borrowers to submit a joint personal loan application, which can be beneficial if the primary borrower has a limited credit history or has a lower credit score. The co-borrower on a personal loan application shares the liability for repaying the loan with the primary borrower which is why lenders may see a borrower as less risky if they have another person applying alongside them. Origination fees are between 2.41% to 5% and get deducted from the loan proceeds. Eligible borrowers Must reside in a state where Prosper is authorized to lend and be at least 18 years of age Loan amounts $2,000 to $50,000 Loan terms 24, 36, 48, and 60 months [ Return to account summary ]\n\nCiti Bank\n\nCiti is a household name in the banking and lending space.

Citi stands out as a personal loan lender because it doesn't charge origination fees, early payoff fees or late fees. This lender also offers a 0.50% rate reduction for enrolling in autopay, which is very generous considering most other lenders only offer a 0.25% interest rate discount. Eligible borrowers Must be at least 18 years old Loan amounts $2,000 to $30,000 Loan terms Up to 60 months [ Return to account summary ] See if you're pre-approved for a personal loan offer.\n\nWhat is considered a quick loan?\n\nLoans that can be disbursed as soon as the same business day as approval (or even one business day later) are typically considered quick loans. Most lenders can provide funding in a few days, usually 3\u20135 business days after approval. However, some lenders who disburse funds through a mailed check can take longer to get you the loan proceeds \u2014 usually closer to a week. That's why a quick loan is the ideal solution for someone who wants (or needs) their money ASAP.\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of quick personal loans?\n\nPros No collateral required: Personal loans generally don't require you to secure the loan with an asset. This is good news since you won't be at risk of losing something valuable, like your car, if you default on the loan. However, there will still be implications to your credit score if you fail to repay your loan, as with any other form of credit.\n\nPersonal loans generally don't require you to secure the loan with an asset.

However, there will still be implications to your credit score if you fail to repay your loan, as with any other form of credit. Lower interest rates: Personal loans generally carry lower interest rates compared to credit cards (unless you have a credit card with a 0% intro APR). This makes them a more affordable alternative. Just keep in mind that applying with a higher credit score makes you eligible for.\n\nPersonal loans generally carry lower interest rates compared to credit cards (unless you have a credit card with a 0% intro APR).

Longer repayment terms generally mean lower monthly payments. Lump sum disbursement: Borrowers receive their funding in the form of a lump sum deposited into their bank account. This provides ultimate flexibility in when and how you use the funds. Cons Potentially numerous fees: Unlike credit cards, personal loans often come with origination fees, application fees and sometimes even prepayment penalties. These fees can add onto the cost of borrowing a personal loan. Though, it is possible to find lenders that don't charge these fees.\n\nUnlike credit cards, personal loans often come with origination fees, application fees and sometimes even prepayment penalties. These fees can add onto the cost of borrowing a personal loan. Though, it is possible to find lenders that don't charge these fees. Higher monthly payments: For the most part, credit cards require a low minimum monthly payment (though, experts advise paying off your balance in full each month). With personal loans, though, your monthly payment is often higher than that of credit cards even if you have a long loan term. Granted, you're able to borrow higher amounts with a personal loan than you would with a credit card.\n\nHow do you apply for a quick loan?\n\nFirst, you should compare different quick loans. Many lenders will let you check (for free) on their websites what interest rate you'll likely receive with them. This lets you eliminate the high-rate options and hone in on your preferred lender. Once you've picked your lender, you then apply for a loan. This will trigger a hard inquiry on your credit history, which lowers your score a little, so don't apply for more than one loan if you can help it. The application usually requires you to submit personal information like your address, social security number and the loan purpose. The best way to receive a loan quickly is to ensure all information is accurate and complete. Errors or failure to submit complete information could delay the approval process.\n\nWhat are the credit requirements for a quick loan?\n\nCredit requirements depend on the lender. Most lenders want to see good-to-excellent credit, but a handful of lenders cater to borrowers with fair or poor credit. Be sure to double-check with the lender before applying.\n\nFAQs What is a personal loan? A personal loan is a type of installment credit that allows borrowers to receive a one-time lump sum of cash. Borrowers must then pay back that amount plus interest in regular, monthly installments over the loan's term. How do you apply for a personal loan? When applying for a personal loan, you'll need to provide some basic pieces of information, which can include your address, social security number and date of birth, among others. You may also be required to submit pay stubs as proof of income. Some lenders may also require your bank account information. An application can typically be submitted online or in person if the lender has physical branches that you can visit. How do you get a personal loan with bad credit? Some lenders offer personal loans that cater to borrowers with lower credit scores, and may allow borrowers with bad credit to apply with co-borrowers. It's always advised to try to improve your credit score before applying for any form of credit since it can be difficult to qualify with lower credit scores. Additionally, lower credit scores tend to be subject to higher interest rates. What is an unsecured personal loan? An unsecured loan is a form of credit that doesn't require you to put up collateral that can be used to settle your balance if you default on the loan. Most personal loans are unsecured loans.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhen you need money in a pinch, many personal loan lenders can get you funded as soon as the same business day. Make sure your application is complete and free from inaccuracies to ensure the process goes smoothly. Any mistakes on your application could delay getting your funds.\n\nSubscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter! Money matters \u2014 so make the most of it.

After reviewing the above features, we sorted our recommendations by best for overall financing needs, quick funding, lower interest rates and flexible terms. Note that the rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate per the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

The Bank of America Advantage Savings account stands apart from other brick-and-mortar offerings because of the special rewards programs you can access if you use a Bank of America credit card or open a Bank of America checking account in tandem with your savings account. Account holders can earn up to 15% cash back on select eligible purchases at stores, restaurants and more with BankAmeriDeals\u00ae when using a Bank of America debit or credit card. The Bank of America Advantage Savings account requires a $100 opening deposit. There is an $8-per-month maintenance fee that is waived for the first 6 months for new account holders. Customers can avoid paying the monthly fee after the intro period by maintaining a minimum daily balance of at least $500, linking their savings account to their Bank of America Advantage Relationship Banking\u00ae checking account or becoming a Bank of America Preferred Rewards member. Students under 24 who are enrolled in school may also qualify for a waiver. There are three tiers to the Bank of America's Preferred Rewards program, and your 3-month average daily balance across your Bank of America deposit and Merrill Lynch/Merrill Edge investment accounts determines which tier you qualify for. You must also have an eligible Bank of America personal checking account to qualify. The tiers include Gold, Platinum and Platinum Honors, and there's a $20,000 minimum balance required. If you qualify and enroll in the Preferred Rewards program, you're also eligible for an elevated APY, ranging from 0.02% to 0.04% depending on which tier. Otherwise, the standard APY is 0.01%. To improve your savings habits, consider enrolling in Bank of America's Keep the Change\u00ae program, which allows account holders to round up their debit card purchases and deposit the difference into their savings account each day. Through the Bank of America mobile app, customers can access Erica\u00ae for customized and real-time virtual financial assistance. The bank has over 4,000 branches and 16,000-plus ATMs throughout the country. A withdrawal limit fee of $10 is applied for each withdrawal over 6 per month, and there is overdraft protection when you link your savings account to your checking account.\n\nBest at Wells Fargo\n\nWay2Save\u00ae Savings Learn More Wells Fargo is a Member FDIC.

With about 5,400 physical locations and over 13,000 ATMs, Wells Fargo Bank is the largest brick-and-mortar bank in the nation by the number of branches. For those looking to open an account at a bank with the most opportunity for in-person access, Wells Fargo is your best choice. Wells Fargo offers two different savings accounts: the basic Way2Save\u00ae Savings and the elevated Platinum Savings. CNBC Select chose Way2Save as the better savings account option because it has a lower minimum daily balance requirement to avoid the monthly service fee ($5 per month for Way2Save and $12 per month for Platinum). To avoid these fees, account holders must either maintain a $300 minimum daily balance or set up their choice of automatic transfers from their checking to their savings: $25 in total, $1 each business day per month or at least one Save As You Go\u00ae transfer. With Save As You Go, it's easy to set aside cash. Wells Fargo automatically transfers $1 of a customer's funds from their linked Wells Fargo checking account to their Way2Save account for each qualifying transaction that is a non-recurring debit card purchase or online bill payment using Wells Fargo Online\u00ae Bill Pay. To accelerate completing your savings goals, you can set up additional automatic transfers from your checking account each month. There is a $25 minimum opening deposit for this savings account, and those who link a Wells Fargo checking account can opt for overdraft protection. The APY on this account is currently 0.15%.\n\nBest at Chase Bank\n\nChase Premier Savings\u2120 Learn More Chase Bank is a Member FDIC.

Pros Chase Bank has a vast network of ATMs\n\nUsers have the option to earn a higher APY\n\nMonthly maintenance fee can be waived by linking to a checking account\n\nNo minimum deposit to open an account\n\nUp to 6 free withdrawals or transfers per statement cycle Cons Has monthly maintenance fees\n\nLow APY (although option to earn higher) Learn More View More\n\nWho's this for? If you are looking for a broad network of ATMs to avoid any out-of-network fees and want a chance to earn a slightly higher APY, consider the savings accounts offered by Chase. Chase Bank has nearly 4,900 branches and 16,000 ATMs. Like Wells Fargo, Chase offers two brick-and-mortar savings accounts: the standard Chase Savings\u2120 and the Chase Premier Savings\u2120. The latter is stronger because you can earn better interest rates (what Chase calls \"relationship rates\") on higher balances by linking your savings to a Chase Premier Plus Checking\u2120 or Chase Sapphire\u2120 Banking and making at least five transactions in a month using your linked checking account. If you don't link your Chase Premier Savings account to a Chase checking account, the APY is 0.01%. But the APY creeps up slightly if you do have a linked account. For example, you can earn 0.02% APY if you also have a Premier Plus Checking or Chase Sapphire Banking account. By linking to a checking account, you also avoid the monthly $25 service fee that comes with the Chase Premier Savings. Otherwise, there's a daily minimum balance of $15,000 required. There is no minimum deposit required to open an account. If you choose to link a Chase Sapphire Banking account, you can take advantage of Sapphire\u2120 Banking perks, which include special access to sports and entertainment events and early ticket sales. Chase also has an automatic savings program where customers can get help reaching their set savings goals in the bank's mobile app. There is a $5 savings withdrawal limit fee when you make over six withdrawals in a month, including those made at a branch or at an ATM. This fee is waived with a balance of $15,000 or more in the account at the time of withdrawal.\n\nBest at U.S. Bank\n\nU.S. Bank Standard Savings Learn More U.S. Bank National Association is a Member FDIC.

If you want a simple, no-frills and low cost savings account at a brick-and-mortar bank, U.S. Bank's Standard Savings Account is for you. With about 2,700 branches and 4,500 ATMs, U.S. Bank has a smaller physical presence than the other national banks on this list, mostly across the Midwest and Western parts of the U.S. However, as its name suggests, the Standard Savings Account is a straightforward option if you live near a U.S. Bank location. Potential savers can open an account with a $25 minimum deposit. The monthly maintenance fee is $4 a month. The fee is waived for account holders who have a $300 minimum daily balance, a $1,000 average monthly collected balance or are under 18. The APY offered is 0.01% on all balances, and you can take advantage of overdraft protection when linking your savings account to your U.S. Bank checking account.\n\nBest at Citibank\n\nCiti\u00ae Savings Account Learn More Deposit products are provided by Citibank, N.A.

The Citi\u00ae Savings Account is ideal for those who appreciate robust digital banking features but still want access to physical branches. Citibank is the nation's third-largest bank, but has far fewer branches than some competitors, with only about 700 branches in the U.S. Customers have access to over 65,000 surcharge-free ATMs in the U.S. and can take advantage of a range of online banking features, including mobile check deposit, hassle-free transfers and easy online bill payments. Citi stands out for offering a higher APY than its brick-and-mortar competitors with a 3.85% APY. There is no minimum deposit required to open an account. Customers can avoid paying the low monthly fee by maintaining a minimum daily balance of at least $500 or linking their savings account to their checking account and either making one enhanced direct deposit and one qualifying bill payment per statement period or maintaining a $1,500 average monthly collected balance.\n\nBest at PNC Bank\n\nVirtual Wallet\u00ae from PNC Bank Learn More PNC Bank is a Member FDIC.

PNC Bank is a large brick-and-mortar bank with approximately 2,300 branch locations and nearly 18,000 PNC and PNC Partner ATMs. It stands out on our list for its savings account option called Virtual Wallet\u00ae, which uses innovative online tools to make it easy to see how you're managing your money day to day. The account is best for those who want to do all their banking in one place as it rewards you for combining your savings and checking into one. New account holders can earn a welcome bonus of up to $400 depending on what type of Virtual Wallet they open. The three choices include Virtual Wallet, Virtual Wallet with Performance Spend and Virtual Wallet with Performance Select. The simple Virtual Wallet has basic account features while the two other options offer more premium rewards. For those enrolled in school, there is also a Virtual Wallet Student option. All of the above Virtual Wallet options include individual accounts that work together: Spend, Reserve and Growth. Spend is your everyday checking account, Reserve your interest-bearing checking account / primary overdraft protection account and Growth is your long-term savings account / secondary overdraft protection account. Higher \"relationship\" interest rates are available on your Growth savings account. The monthly service charges range from $7 to $25, depending on the type of Virtual Wallet you have and can be waived depending on minimum balances in your Spend + Reserve checking accounts (required balances and minimum deposits vary according to the type of Virtual Wallet you have). Virtual Wallet account holders can make free transactions at approximately 9,000 PNC-owned ATMs, and if you end up using a non-PNC ATM, some fees are reimbursed. Through the PNC Purchase Payback\u00ae program, customers can also earn cash back or points on purchases made using their PNC Bank Visa\u00ae Debit Card which is automatically issued when they sign up for Virtual Wallet. The customized rewards program has offers available from participating merchants depending on your shopping habits. If you're looking for a more straightforward account, PNC Bank also offers a Standard Savings Account.

Whereas online-only banks don't have to pay high overhead costs to operate physical branches, brick-and-mortar banks have costly expenses that are usually passed on to their customers.\n\nWhy trust CNBC Select?\n\nAt CNBC Select, our mission is to provide our readers with high-quality service journalism and comprehensive consumer advice so they can make informed decisions with their money. Every brick-and-mortar savings account review is based on rigorous reporting by our team of expert writers and editors with extensive knowledge of banking products. While CNBC Select earns a commission from affiliate partners on many offers and links, we create all our content without input from our commercial team or any outside third parties, and we pride ourselves on our journalistic standards and ethics. See our methodology for more information on how we choose the best brick-and-mortar savings accounts.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo determine which brick-and-mortar savings accounts offer the most convenience, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. savings accounts offered by the largest national banks and credit unions. We narrowed down our ranking by only considering those savings accounts that come from brick-and-mortar banks with broad availability, offering access to at least 700 physical branches and over 4,000 non-fee ATMs in the U.S. While the accounts we chose in this article are from the largest banks, we compared each savings account on a range of features, including its fees, opportunities to earn higher interest rates, customer service and any other special offerings or programs. We also considered factors such as insurance policies, users' deposit options, other savings accounts being offered by the same bank and customer reviews when available. All of the accounts included on this list are FDIC-insured up to $250,000. Note that the interest rates and fee structures for brick-and-mortar savings accounts are subject to change without notice. Product and feature availability vary by market so they may not be offered depending on where you live. Most brick-and-mortar banks require you to enter your zip code online for the correct account offerings. Any return on your savings depends on the associated fees and the balance you have in your brick-and-mortar savings account. To open a savings account, most banks and institutions require a deposit of new money, meaning you can't transfer money you already had in an account at that bank.

For a conventional mortgage, lenders typically approve qualified borrowers with a down payment of 5% or more. Anything less than that is considered a low down payment. What are some common types of low-down-payment mortgages? FHA loans, VA loans and USDA loans are all popular types of low-down-payment mortgages insured by government agencies, each with its own eligibility requirements. In addition, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac back HomeReady, Home Possible and HomeOne mortgages. Many banks have proprietary mortgages with low down payments: With Rocket Mortgage's Rocket ONE+ loan, for example, you can put as little as 1% down without private mortgage insurance. Do I have to put down 20% to buy a home? The median down payment for first-time homebuyers between July 2022 and June 2023 was 8%, according to the National Association of Realtors. Putting less than 20% down, however, will likely mean you'll have to pay private mortgage insurance.\n\nSubscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter! Money matters \u2014 so make the most of it.

See our methodology for more information on how we choose the best small down payment mortgages.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo determine which mortgage lenders are the best, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. mortgages offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions, that come with fixed-rate APRs and flexible loan amounts and terms to suit an array of financing needs. When narrowing down and ranking the best mortgages, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n\nVariable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan.

We also opted for lenders with an online resource hub or advice center to help you educate yourself about the personal loan process and your finances. Minimum down payment: Although minimum down payment amounts depend on the type of loan a borrower applies for, we noted lenders that offer additional specialty loans that come with a lower minimum down payment amount. After reviewing the above features, we sorted our recommendations by best for no down payment, affordability, no lender fees, low-income borrowers, VA loans, USDA loans and online lenders. Rates and fee structures advertised for mortgages fluctuate in accordance with the Federal Reserve rate. However, once you accept your mortgage agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee your interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan, unless you choose to refinance your mortgage at a later date for a potentially lower APR. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history, creditworthiness, debt-to-income ratio and the desired loan term. To take out a mortgage, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.
