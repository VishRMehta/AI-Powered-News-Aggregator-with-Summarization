        "title": "Strikes inside Russia with US missiles key to Ukraine\u2019s plan to end war, says Zelenskyy",
        "text": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged Joe Biden to allow Ukraine to carry out long-range strikes inside Russia with US-supplied weapons, and to earn \u201ca place in history\u201d by \u201cstrengthening Ukraine\u201d before he leaves office.\n\nSpeaking before a crucial trip next week to Washington, where he will meet Biden and the US vice-president and presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, and address the UN, Zelenskyy said he would present a \u201cvictory plan\u201d to end the war.\n\nHis vision for a \u201cjust peace\u201d has not been made public. But in a media briefing with the Observer in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said it involved carrying out deep strikes with western missiles inside Russia \u2013 something London and Washington have so far refused.\n\nThe UK has indicated it is willing to allow Ukraine to use British Storm Shadow cruise missiles. But the White House remains sceptical. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, failed to resolve the issue when he held private talks last week with Biden in Washington.\n\nZelenskyy confirmed no green light had been given, despite months of high-level lobbying. \u201cNeither the US nor UK has allowed us to use these weapons on the territory of Russia, against any targets and at any distance,\u201d he said.\n\nStorm Shadows, the French equivalent, Scalp, and the US Atacms system have \u201cnot been provided in the numbers we need\u201d, Zelenskyy added. He suggested the reluctance of international partners could be explained by fear of \u201cescalation\u201d with Moscow \u2013 an analysis Kyiv does not share.\n\nAsked how he might persuade Biden when they meet on Thursday, Zelenskyy cited the fact that the outgoing president had in the past \u201cchanged his opinions\u201d after \u201cdifficult discussions\u201d. Some US members of his entourage supported strikes, he said \u2013 which was \u201calready an achievement\u201d.\n\nZelenskyy added: \u201cBiden can strengthen Ukraine and make important decisions for Ukraine to become stronger and to protect its independence while he is US president. I think it is a historical mission after all.\u201d\n\nAs well as meeting Harris, Zelenskyy said he would \u201cmost likely\u201d have a meeting with Donald Trump on Thursday or Friday. \u201cOur teams are in contact. The main thing is to have time [together]. I won\u2019t look into the future, but I think it will be important for both of us,\u201d Zelenskyy said.\n\nTrump\u2019s running mate, JD Vance, has said a future Republican administration envisages a Moscow-friendly deal that would see Russia hang on to the territory it currently occupies. Ukraine would be forbidden from joining Nato, with the war frozen along a demarcation line.\n\nZelenskyy described Ukraine\u2019s incursion last month into Russia\u2019s Kursk oblast as a success, hinting that it could become part of future negotiations. He said the operation prevented Moscow from launching its own attack on Ukraine\u2019s northern Sumy province. The \u201cenemy\u201d had been forced to redeploy 42,000 troops from other parts of the frontline, he said.\n\nHe acknowledged the situation in eastern Ukraine remained difficult. He said Kyiv needed long-range weapons to counter Russian attacks using airdropped guided bombs. These \u201cdestroyed everything\u201d, he said. Russia \u201cfinished off\u201d with artillery and then sent in infantry to capture Ukrainian positions.\n\nThe Kremlin, meanwhile, had already moved planes to other, more remote airfields, in anticipation that the White House would sign off on Atacms strikes. \u201cWe cannot simply talk about Atacms. Why? Because it\u2019s too late,\u201d Zelenskyy said, saying \u201cserious decisions\u201d were needed.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

During his trip he will meet representatives from Congress and discuss his victory plan with Harris.\n\nThe proposal, ahead of a global peace summit in November organised by Ukraine, envisages further security guarantees. Zelenskyy said the \u201cKursk operation\u201d also featured. He declined to give details. Other elements include more weapons and economic support.\n\nIn a tweet on Thursday, Biden described Zelenskyy warmly as \u201cmy friend\u201d. \u201cDuring his visit, I\u2019ll reaffirm America\u2019s commitment to supporting Ukraine as it defends its freedom and independence,\u201d Biden wrote.\n\nLast week, Vladimir Putin said missile strikes against Russia with US weapons would be tantamount to Nato joining the war. He threatened severe consequences. Ukrainian officials have dismissed his comments as the latest in a series of meaningless bluffs.\n\nThe Atacms system has a 190-mile (300km) range. Its ballistic missiles can carry cluster munitions. They are likely to be highly effective in destroying Russian bases and military runways, from where airstrikes are launched against Ukrainian towns and cities, defence experts say.\n\nStorm Shadow missiles were developed together with France and rely on US guidance systems. They include Italian components. All four countries have to sign off on any change to the conditions attached to their use, even if they are not the direct suppliers themselves.\n\nUkraine\u2019s own long-range drones have proved increasingly effective against Russian military targets. On Saturday, they hit an ammunition depot in Russia\u2019s Krasnodar Krai region, causing a massive explosion. Another attack two days ago set fire to a weapons dump in the town of Toropets, in the Tver region.",

        "text": "A former Harrods worker has criticised Harrods for the way it handled the alleged misconduct of the store\u2019s former owner Mohamed Al Fayed.\n\nFive women have alleged they were raped by Fayed, who died last year at the age of 94, and a number of others have alleged sexual misconduct.\n\nThe former Harrods worker, who wished to remain anonymous, criticised Harrods for saying that Fayed\u2019s actions were the actions of an individual. \u201cThere were people at Harrods at the time who were enablers and they are as guilty as Al Fayed, because they were not just passive onlookers. They were actually helping to send girl after girl into a total nightmare.\u201d\n\nThe woman, who said she worked at Harrods in a junior role, said she was called up to Fayed\u2019s office. \u201cWe went into a little room at the back, just him and me, and he said to me: \u2018Come work in my office \u2013 one year here and you could be a buyer.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen she politely explained that she was happy where she was, she said he held her hand and asked if she had a boyfriend. \u201cThis was something that I\u2019ve then heard he asked lots of people who\u2019ve been interviewed over the last couple of days.\u201d\n\nHe then informed her that he was her boyfriend, kissed her on the forehead and handed her \u00a3300 in cash. He told her to think about the job offer and come back the following week. She later returned the cash to his office in an envelope, along with a polite letter declining the job.\n\nThe former Harrods employee said after describing the encounter to her male line manager, he \u201cbrushed it off\u201d and told her: \u201cThat\u2019s just what he\u2019s like.\u201d\n\nWhen she resigned shortly afterwards to pursue a different role, she said she was called to Fayed\u2019s office to explain why she was leaving, which she found \u201ca pretty extreme reaction, given how junior and replaceable she was\u201d.\n\nShe said her experience \u201cfeels like absolutely nothing\u201d compared with some of the harrowing testimony women have come forward with over the past few days. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s important as part of building up that evidence of a pattern of behaviour.\u201d\n\nIn its statement on the BBC documentary Al Fayed: Predator at Harrods, which aired on Thursday, Harrods said it was \u201ca very different organisation to the one owned and controlled by Al Fayed between 1985 and 2010\u201d.\n\nThe store added that \u201csince new information came to light in 2023 about historic allegations of sexual abuse by Al Fayed, it has been our priority to settle claims in the quickest way possible, avoiding lengthy legal proceedings for the women involved\u201d.",

Referring to members of staff at Fulham, he said: \u201cWe were aware he liked young, blond girls. So we just made sure that situations couldn\u2019t occur.

He bought Fulham in 1997 and the Ritz in Paris in 1979.\n\nThe culture, media and sport secretary, Lisa Nandy, told the BBC she was pleased that Fulham was carrying out an investigation. \u201cToo often, what we see in these cases is, institutions try and withdraw and protect themselves rather than be open and transparent,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said the case highlighted the need to protect people in their workplace from abuse by powerful individuals.\n\nAt a news conference on Friday, lawyers representing Fayed\u2019s accusers said they suspected there were more victims from other places where Fayed worked. \u201cWherever he went, there will be victims,\u201d barrister Maria Mulla said.\n\nOn Saturday, Bruce Drummond, part of the legal team that represents 37 alleged victims, said more women had come forward since the BBC investigation aired.

        "text": "Three children and seven women were among 37 people killed by an Israeli strike on Beirut that targeted a top Hezbollah leader in a densely populated neighbourhood, Lebanese authorities have said, as US and UN officials warned against further escalation.\n\nOn Saturday, Israel closed its northern airspace as it awaited Hezbollah retaliation for the assassination of Ibrahim Aqil, a veteran commander of the elite Radwan unit, along with more than a dozen other militants. On Saturday afternoon, fires broke out after a barrage of rockets from Lebanon.\n\nAirlines including Air France, Turkish Airlines, and Aegean cancelled flights to Beirut, reflecting fears that a tumultuous week had pushed the region closer to full-blown war.\n\nThe strike on Aqil destroyed an underground bunker and brought down the building on top of it during rush hour, when the streets were filled with people returning from home and school. On Saturday, workers were still digging through the rubble, the Associated Press reported.\n\nIsrael has not visibly slowed its war in Gaza to focus on the north. On Saturday its forces bombed a school turned shelter, killing at least 22 and injuring 30 others, mostly women and children, the Gaza health ministry said. Israel\u2019s military said the target was a Hamas base inside the school, without providing details or evidence.\n\nLast week, however, Israel said it was expanding its strategic aims for the Gaza war to include returning 60,0000 evacuated residents of northern Israel to their homes, which are regularly targeted by Hezbollah. It then unleashed a series of unprecedented attacks on the group.\n\nFirst thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah members detonated, killing and maiming their owners but also hitting civilian bystanders, including children. The next day, walkie-talkies exploded, then Israel unleashed an intense bombing campaign on southern Lebanon before hitting Aqil.\n\nIt was a spectacular show of military and intelligence strength, and long-term planning, embarrassing for the Hezbollah leadership and devastating in immediate military terms, decimating the top leadership and the rank and file.\n\nBut many inside and outside Israel warned that the strategic implications of the week-long assault are far less clear than its immediate tactical impact.\n\nNeither Israel nor Hezbollah is thought to want further escalation, but \u201cthe margin is very, very narrow now\u201d for avoiding it, as Hezbollah contemplates how to respond, the former head of Israel\u2019s national security council said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah] is interested in total war, but at the same time he cannot avoid a response,\u201d said the retired major general Giora Eiland. \u201cThe question is: can he find something creative enough that \u2026 it will not drag both sides to total war?\u201d\n\nHezbollah\u2019s arsenal and military experience mean that, for Israel, such a conflict would be \u201cprobably the most painful we ever had\u201d, he added.\n\nLate on Friday, the UN political affairs chief, Rosemary DiCarlo, also warned of the fallout of a broader conflict. \u201cWe risk seeing a conflagration that could dwarf even the devastation and suffering witnessed so far,\u201d she said, calling for urgent diplomatic efforts \u201cto avoid such folly\u201d.\n\n\u201cI strongly urge member states with influence over the parties to leverage it now,\u201d she told a meeting of the UN security council convened to discuss the Israeli attacks.\n\nIn the US, President Joe Biden\u2019s top adviser on the Middle East, Brett McGurk, warned that despite fully backing Israel\u2019s defence against Hezbollah, Washington does not think military actions will restore life to northern Israel.\n\n\u201cWe do not think a war in Lebanon is the way to achieve the objective to return people to their homes,\u201d he told the Israeli-American Council\u2019s national summit, Haaretz newspaper reported.\n\n\u201cWe have disagreements with the Israelis on tactics and how you measure escalation risk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we speak with them about every single day. It is a very concerning situation.\u201d\n\nThe US has insisted for months that the path to peace in the north lies through Gaza, as Biden has pushed for a ceasefire and hostage release deal. McGurk said the US focus was also on \u201ca diplomatic settlement to the north\u201d.\n\nOn Friday, Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said the military would continue to target Hezbollah. \u201cThe sequence of actions in the new phase will continue until our goal is achieved: the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes,\u201d he said in a post on X.\n\nHezbollah began launching attacks in support of its ally Hamas after 7 October, and has indicated it will stop targeting Israel when the Gaza Strip offensive stops, unless Israel continues shelling Lebanon.\n\nMonths of missile, rocket and drone hits have killed at least 23 soldiers and 26 civilians, and in effect turned Israel\u2019s border regions near Lebanon into a strategic buffer zone, too dangerous for ordinary life.\n\nInside Lebanon, more than 500 people have been killed by Israeli strikes, most of them fighters with Hezbollah and other armed groups, but also more than 100 civilians.",

        "title": "Could this be the week Netanyahu goes from pariah to international fugitive?",
        "text": "One year ago, Benjamin Netanyahu came to the UN with a vision of a \u201cnew Middle East\u201d anchored by Israel\u2019s growing ties with its Arab partners in the region. Now he is on the brink of launching a major escalation against Hezbollah, ignoring calls for restraint from his allies over the Gaza war and defying criticism that he is prevaricating in negotiations over a temporary ceasefire.\n\nThe Israeli PM remains scheduled to speak on Friday at the UN general assembly in an appearance that is sure to lead to walkouts and protests on the streets of midtown Manhattan.\n\nHe has delayed his arrival in the US by at least a day as tensions rise with Lebanon, after an elaborate operation to detonate thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah that may signal the beginning of a broader war in the region.\n\nThe trip to New York may offer him a chance to evaluate support for an escalation in Lebanon, or to let Joe Biden and other allies know that he had made his decision and would not be talked down from a broader war.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s trip to the UN comes after a year of bloodshed in Gaza that has left more than 41,000 people dead and led the international criminal court (ICC) to consider issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Hamas\u2019s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. The ICC judges are regularly rumoured to be close to approving a warrant that could accuse Netanyahu of war crimes.\n\nAmong those killed during the Gaza conflict have been 200 UN humanitarian aid workers. Netanyahu and the Israel Defense Forces have made claims that staff from the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) had taken part in the 7 October Hamas-led attacks, and nine members of the organisation had their contracts terminated after an internal UN review.\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, has said that he and Netanyahu have not spoken since the beginning of the war, but that he was ready to meet him on the sidelines of the summit if the Israeli PM asked.\n\n\u201cI have not talked to him because he didn\u2019t pick up my phone calls, but I have no reason not to speak with him,\u201d Guterres said.

On the streets outside near Union Station, protesters clashed with police and defaced marble statues with paint.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Netanyahu is ready to take a step further towards the abyss. Following an airstrike in Beirut on Friday that killed a senior Hezbollah commander and at least 13 others in Beirut\u2019s Dahiyeh area, Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant said that \u201ceven in Dahiyeh in Beirut \u2013 we will continue to pursue our enemy in order to protect our citizens\u201d.\n\nThe new \u201cseries of operations in the new phase of the war will continue until we achieve our goal: ensuring the safe return of Israel\u2019s northern communities to their homes,\u201d he said.\n\nGuterres had said that he viewed the booby-trapped pager attack against Hezbollah as a potential prelude to a military escalation by Israel in Lebanon and warned that the region was on the \u201cbrink of catastrophe\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She has a partner of 16 years, Emily, who is a GP, and two children.\n\nIt is understood that officers do not believe there to have been any third-party involvement in her death. Police had called her disappearance \u201cout of character\u201d and had warned that they were \u201cincreasingly concerned for her welfare\u201d.\n\nOne of her anaesthetist colleagues described Watson, who was the head of chaplaincy at Newcastle NHS trust, as \u201cour rock during the worst parts of the pandemic\u201d.\n\nOthers paid tribute to \u201can amazing woman\u201d with an \u201cinfectious smile\u201d who was dedicated to helping others.\n\nA well-known local figure, she appeared on two series of the documentary about the hospital with her welfare hound, Poppy, and had previously served in the army, touring Bosnia and Croatia in the 1990s where she said she saw \u201cgenocide first-hand on the streets\u201d.\n\nIn 2007, five years after she left the army to begin her ordination training, she became a hospital chaplain, comforting patients and their families through some of the most painful days of their lives and overseeing at the hospital a team of 13 chaplains from different faiths.\n\nShe explained on the first series of the Channel 4 show that she felt the role of a chaplain requires a great deal of resilience and life experience.\n\n\u201cThe work we do is often very distressing and disturbing,\u201d she said. \u201cI have seen the worst of humanity and I have seen, and continue to see, the very best of it.\u201d\n\nIn a joint statement the Bishop of Newcastle, Rt Rev Dr Helen-Ann Hartley, and the Bishop of Berwick, Rt Rev Mark Wroe, said they mourned Watson\u2019s death with a \u201cprofound sense of sadness and grief\u201d and a \u201cdeep feeling of loss\u201d.\n\nThey said she lived out her vocation with \u201cservice, compassion and humility\u201d and expressed their grief, love and prayers to her family, friends and colleagues.\n\nSupt Darren Adams, of Northumbria police, said: \u2018This is an incredibly sad outcome and our thoughts are with Katherine\u2019s loved ones at this\u200b difficult time.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to support them in any way we can and we ask that their privacy is respected.\n\n\u201cOur thanks go to everyone who shared our appeals, provided information and supported our search for Katherine.\u201d",

Eze wiggles past three United players and wins a corner. Share\n\n5m ago 18.33 BST Subs for Palace! Ismaila Sarr and Jefferson Lerma, replacing Adam Wharton and Jean-Philippe Mateta. So presumably Eddie Nketiah will move into the middle. Share\n\n6m ago 18.31 BST Palace are showing the fans their new mascot. She\u2019s an actual eagle, only four months old, called Phoenix.

In Crystal Palace half, not dangerous, not a build-up of offences?\u201d It\u2019s a fair point. Share\n\n10m ago 18.28 BST Erik ten Hag has a simple decision to make: stick or twist. On past form, he\u2019ll stick for at least 15 minutes, because Garnacho and Zirkzee have been pretty good. But Rashford must be itching to get out there. Share\n\n16m ago 18.22 BST HALF-TIME! Palace 0-0 Man United After only a minute of added time, the whistle goes. For the past two minutes, Palace have been as dangerous as we expected. And although United have played well, they have sweet FA to show for it. The best player has been Dean Henderson, the best attacker Alejandro Garnacho Share\n\n21m ago 18.17 BST 45 min You wait 44 minutes for a Palace shot, then \u2026 Mateta has a go from distance, but Martinez has no trouble blocking it. Share\n\n22m ago 18.15 BST Palace have a shot! 44 min Nketiah does well, motoring sideways, holding off Mainoo, and slipping a through ball to Mitchell. His cutback finds Eze, whose crisp low shot draws a first save from Onana. Share Updated at 18.16 BST\n\n24m ago 18.13 BST 42 min Save! Henderson tips the ball round the post as Zirkzee gets a flick on a low cross from Fernandes. Share\n\n25m ago 18.12 BST 41 min Half-chance for Mainoo, in that zone he loves, whence he scored at Wolves. He strikes the ball well but it hits the head of Eriksen, who responds with a wry smile. Share\n\n27m ago 18.11 BST 40 min A lovely flowing move from United, a series of diagonals from Eriksen at left-half to Amad on the right wing. His backheel releases Fernandes, whose chipped cross floats too close to Henderson.

Share\n\n38m ago 17.59 BST 28 min \u201cEvening Mr de Lisle,\u201d says Adam Hirst. \u201cNot sure the United bench is as heavyweight as it should be, but it looks like it could be amongst the most expensive benches in football history. I imagine PSG have had a good go at it, especially any time Neymar or Mbappe started there.\u201d Good call\u2026 though Rashford didn\u2019t cost anything. Share Updated at 18.00 BST\n\n38m ago 17.59 BST Garnacho hits the bar! 26 min The best chance yet, and Garnacho should have buried it.

Erik ten Hag gets his own back when, after praising Palace\u2019s aggression, he observes: \u201cThey make a lot of tactical fouls.\u201d Asked whether it was a difficult decision to bench Rashford, he says: \u201cNo, it is not a difficult decision. We have to rotate, we have so many games to cover and we have to give Alejandro [Garnacho] games. We\u2019ve seen he has a lot of end product, so many goals and assists, and he has only started one time this season.\u201d Share\n\n1h ago 17.11 BST Erik ten Hag\u2019s other surprise comes in midfield. Manuel Ugarte, who started in the Carabao, has to wait for his first league start as Christian Eriksen retains his place. Eriksen was at his gleaming best on Tuesday as the No 10, but when starting in the pivot with Kobbie Mainoo, he has quite a shaky record \u2013 won 3, drawn 2, lost 2. And one of those losses was at Selhurst Park in May.

Eddie Nketiah, who once overcame United almost singlehandedly for Arsenal, starts up front next to Jean-Philippe Mateta. Share\n\n2h ago 16.43 BST Teams in brief: Rashford benched! Well this is a surprise. Marcus Rashford, who has three goals in his last game and a half, is dropped to the bench. Amad returns on the right, Alejandro Garnacho keeps his place on the left after being involved in four of the seven goals against Barnsley, and Joshua Zirkzee is back as the No.9-and-a-half. Maybe Rashford has a niggle, or maybe this is why Erik ten Hag was talking about him needing to be resilient. In better news for United fans, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund are both fit enough to be among the subs. It all adds up to a heavyweight bench. Share",

        "text": "Traffic came to a standstill on Saturday afternoon in Milan as Madonna arrived at Dolce & Gabbana fashion week show. Widely rumoured to be a front-row guest, the singer was the last to arrive at the brand\u2019s HQ, prompting a spontaneous standing ovation from the 1,000-strong crowd.\n\nA long-term friend of designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana and ambassador for their brand since the early 1990s, Madonna was dressed in a head-to-toe black lace look from the brand\u2019s last collection and wore a gold crown atop a black Chantilly lace veil as she chatted with her front-row neighbours before the show began.\n\nThe show itself, called Italian Beauty, was a dedication to Madonna\u2019s 1990 Blonde Ambition tour wardrobe, designed by Jean Paul Gaultier, and the titular theme.\n\nView image in fullscreen Italian designers Stefano Gabbana (r) and Domenico Dolce (c) greet Madonna at the end of the Dolce & Gabbana fashion show at Milan fashion week SS25 on 21 September. Photograph: Matteo Bazzi/EPA\n\nDescending from a penthouse-style staircase, each model sported the conical bra bustier that Madonna wore during the tour and blond corkscrew-curl wigs reminiscent of the style she sported at the time and documented in the fly-on-the-wall documentary In Bed with Madonna. They were joined by pencil dresses with corset and suspender detailing; sheer lace overlays revealing more conical bras and big pants; and black and pinstripe tailoring that all featured in the music video for Vogue.\n\nAs the designers took their final bow, they made the unusual decision to walk the catwalk in search of their front-row muse who stood to receive kisses on her hands and more applause from the crowd.\n\nIt was not the first time that Dolce & Gabbana had dedicated a collection inspired by the platinum artist. In 2000, they presented their spring/summer 2001 collection entitled Madonna, Gli Anni Ottanta, preceded by the costumes they designed for her The Girlie Show tour in 1992.\n\n\u201cMadonna has always been our icon. It\u2019s thanks to her that a lot of things in our lives changed,\u201d the designers wrote in the show notes.\n\nJason Hughes, fashion and creative director of Wallpaper* magazine, said after the show: \u201cMadonna has always engaged in her Italian American heritage long before she became Madonna the pop star and she has a long history with Dolce & Gabbana. They are a match made in heaven \u2013 think of their shared 1990s notoriety relating to religious iconography, sex appeal and female power. The Blonde Ambition era was Madonna at the height of her fame and power when she was the biggest superstar on the planet and in the newspapers every day. It\u2019s hard when you\u2019re working at that level to accept and understand how important it is what one has done, but now she can. This feels like her accepting how major it was.\u201d\n\nThe Observer understands that Gaultier was not involved with the concept or realisation of the collection with the brand, and that the show was a homage to Madonna and the theme. Gaultier, who the Observer has approached for comment, continues to collaborate with Madonna.\n\nLast June, it was reported that the designer was working on an animated feature directed by Beno\u00eet Philippon in which Madonna is to star, so one might assume that this collection has his blessing.",
