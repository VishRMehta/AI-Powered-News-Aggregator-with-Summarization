        "title": "Tesla Superchargers: All the EV brands that have access",
        "text": "Eighteen months ago, Ford triggered a transformation when the U.S. automaker locked in a deal to give owners of its EVs access to the Tesla Supercharger network.\n\nIn a stunning shift, automaker after automaker \u2014 from GM and Hyundai to Rivian and Mercedes \u2014 followed suit. By the end of 2023, nearly every major automaker had agreed to adopt Tesla\u2019s North American Charging Standard (NACS) and promised EV owners that adapters would soon be on their way.\n\nMost non-Tesla customers are still waiting. However, GM\u2019s announcement earlier this week may provide an electric lining of optimism.\n\nEV owners of GM vehicles like the Chevrolet Silverado EV and Cadillac Lyriq will now officially have access to Tesla\u2019s Superchargers. All GM EV owners need to do is purchase, and wait for, the GM-approved adapters that will allow their cars to charge on Tesla\u2019s ports.\n\nMore may soon follow. TechCrunch is tracking which brands have access to the Tesla Supercharging Network and will be updating this list.\n\nThe shift to the Tesla EV charging standard\n\nIn November 2022, Tesla shared its EV charging connector design in an effort to encourage network operators and automakers to adopt the technology and help make it the new standard in North America. At the time, every other automaker was using the Combined Charging Standard (CCS) in North America.\n\nMass adoption seemed unlikely at the time even though Tesla\u2019s charging network was considered far superior thanks to its robust and user-friendly design and the ease of paying for the EV juice.\n\nSix months later, Ford became the first to announce it would work with Tesla in a deal that would give its customers access to more than 12,000 Superchargers across the U.S. and Canada. But it wasn\u2019t just about giving Ford EV owners access to a special adapter. Ford also committed to integrating its future EVs with NACS ports instead of CCS.\n\nRivian, GM, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Volkwagen, Porsche, Audi, Hyundai, Kia, Lucid, and Stellantis followed.\n\nTesla charging FAQs\n\nIn the U.S. today, there are 36,499 NACS ports available publicly (although some of those might be from other EV charging companies that have adapted Tesla\u2019s standard), compared to around 16,925 CCS ports. That\u2019s despite federal dollars that have gone explicitly to the buildout of CCS chargers.\n\nFor EV owners stuck with a CCS port, they\u2019ll have to hold out for manufacturer-approved adapters. While there are some third-party adapters that claim to be compliant with certain safety and performance standards, like Lectron\u2019s Vortex Plug for $199, Tesla\u2019s website says such adapters are prohibited.\n\nA GM spokesperson told TechCrunch its adapters have been specifically designed to protect GM EV batteries while charging and that its vehicle warranty doesn\u2019t cover damage to vehicle parts resulting from the use of non-GM approved adapters.\n\nIn late August, Tesla posted on X that it had ramped up production of adapters. That statement, combined with GM\u2019s announcement, could mean that even more non-Tesla EVs will be pulling up to Supercharger stations soon. They\u2019ll all have to download the Tesla app so they can pay for charging.\n\nTesla supercharging access checklist\n\nGeneral Motors\n\nAs of September 2024, GM has finally updated the software on its Chevy, Cadillac, and GMC EVs so customers can use Tesla\u2019s Superchargers. If they want access soon, they need to purchase a \u201cGM approved\u201d adapter through their app for $225.\n\nGM wouldn\u2019t say how long shipping would take. A GM spokesperson said the company already has an inventory of the adapters and that it\u2019s worked with multiple suppliers to manufacture the approved NACS DC fast-charging adapters.\n\nFrom 2025 onward, GM\u2019s EVs will be built with the NACS charge port.\n\nFord\n\nCertain Ford customers officially gained access to Tesla Superchargers in February, but ongoing supply constraints have delayed the delivery of free fast-charging adapters for most customers (although Ford says the delays have affected \u201csome\u201d customers).\n\nCurrent owners of the Mustang Mach-E and Ford F-150 Lightning who have yet to order their adapter can do so through their Ford Pass app. The deadline to apply for a free adapter is September 30.\n\nRivian\n\nEV startup Rivian officially got access to 15,000 Superchargers across North America on March 18, 2024. At the time, Rivian promised to begin sending adapters to customers starting in April. A Rivian spokesperson told TechCrunch the automaker began delivery this spring and continues to ship adapters as quickly as it receives them.\n\nTechCrunch will update the list as automakers gain official access.",

        "title": "Plaud\u2019s $169 ChatGPT-powered NotePin has a permanent place in my travel bag",
        "text": "The Plaud.AI pin took up mercifully little space in my carry-on. It also presented an opportunity to kill two birds: I was flying across the country and knew I would be taking copious notes.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been in a meeting with me, you know I bring my laptop without fail. My dumb brain needs to take notes. That said, the process of typing while listening can be as distracting as it is engaging. At the very least, it stands between you and a natural conversation, especially in those moments when you\u2019re still typing after the other person has finished talking.\n\nSure, you could try to type faster or find a shorthand, but I\u2019ve found that both of these methods have a tendency to render text unreadable. The next obvious step is recording \u2014 with the other person\u2019s permission, of course. Back when I was a cub reporter, standalone digital voice recorders were still a going concern.\n\nThese days, I record on my laptop or place my phone down on the table between myself and the subject. These devices present their own issues, like a lack of proper microphones and the tendency to pick up typing noises when doing double duty. I find myself harboring some light nostalgia for the days of my little Olympus recorder with its built-in USB-A dongle.\n\nPlaud.AI\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre lives somewhere among the above scenarios. Earlier this year, the startup launched Plaud Note, a recording device that magnetically snaps to the back of a handset, utilizing ChatGPT to transcribe conversations. While I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to try out that earlier device, I jumped when the company told me about the upcoming NotePin.\n\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\n\nI\u2019m skeptical that the product has a large target audience in the days of do-everything smartphones, but I was sure that I was part of it. Sometimes it feels like I take notes for the sole purpose of having something to do in meetings. I say this because many of my notes just languish, due to an inability to find pertinent information or just general unreadability.\n\nOtter.AI has helped a lot on both fronts when I upload recordings to the AI-based transcription service. Plaud\u2019s process is similar, but more streamlined. In the case of NotePin, you wear it on your wrist or magnetically snapped to your lapel, tap once to record, and tap again to stop. The recordings are saved on your phone in real time, and from there you can decide whether to upload them for transcription, depending on how robust a monthly subscription you have.\n\nThe $169 device comes with 300 free monthly transcription minutes. A Pro plan, meanwhile, is $6.60 a month, quadrupling the transcription minutes and adding a few features like custom templates and \u201cAsk AI,\u201d which the company describes as \u201can AI Agent to extract more information from recordings, information that was not discovered through summary templates, and information that spans multiple recordings.\u201d\n\nUltimately, however, whether you opt in to a Pro account comes down to how much time you spend in meetings per month. Given that most of my meetings are via teleconference, I don\u2019t suspect I\u2019ll upgrade. Who knows, though: Maybe the millions of briefings I take at CES in January will force my hand.\n\nOne thing I really appreciate with Plaud is the company\u2019s deliberate design. The concept of life-logging was a bust. I suspect this is due in large part to the fact that most people don\u2019t want to record all of their daily comings and goings. And the people they encounter generally don\u2019t want to be recorded.\n\nThe NotePin is deliberate in the sense that you tap it to trigger it. It\u2019s an intentional action that\u2019s likely to be noticed by the person sitting across from you. When recording starts, you feel a quick haptic buzz. If that\u2019s not enough to allay your fears, you can open the Plaud app on your phone to see if it\u2019s actually recording. When you\u2019re done, another tap gives you a haptic buzz to signal that the recording has stopped.\n\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\n\nGPT does a good job with the transcriptions and summaries. There\u2019s a mind-mapping tool as well, though I didn\u2019t find that to be especially engaging. Speakers are separated by voice, and the system is capable of managing multiple speakers in 59 languages. The text is clean, the interface is easy to use, and the summaries are useful. It\u2019s also dead simple to share a link to the audio with a colleague.\n\nMy biggest issue presently, as a longtime Otter user, is the inability to tap on words in the transcription to play back the corresponding audio. I suspect it\u2019s something Plaud is planning to add, if the company hasn\u2019t already.\n\nUnlike other AI pins, Plaud\u2019s product feels like a solution to real issues. These are issues I deal with all the time as a journalist. My biggest question at the moment is whether there are enough people in the world like me to sustain Plaud\u2019s business model.",

        "title": "Grok\u2019s image generator, Black Forest Labs, is raising $100M at a $1B valuation, say sources",
        "text": "While OpenAI pursues yet another monster fundraise, it is not stealing all the oxygen in the room: AI startups building promising foundational models can still open doors, and checkbooks. Multiple sources tell us that Black Forest Labs \u2014 a startup that\u2019s building generative AI image models and came out of stealth two months ago with $31 million in funding \u2014 is closing new funding. A $100 million round at a $1 billion valuation is the amount we are hearing. The deal may not be final and so could still be subject to change.\n\nBlack Forest is not just any AI startup: The company was co-founded by the engineers who built the technology behind Stability AI. And it has a big-name customer. Elon Musk\u2019s X.ai is using Black Forest\u2019s Flux.1 text-to-image model to power image generation in its Grok chatbot. That\u2019s a service that set people chattering immediately after it was launched in part because of the audacious results people generated with it.\n\nImage Credits: Screenshot\n\nImage Credits: Screenshot\n\n\u201cNo filters\u201d still appears to be a thing a month later. We created the image on the right earlier this week.\n\nThe company is also catching the eye of investors because of its founders and founding team. They include Andreas Blattmann, Patrick Esser, Dominik Lorenz and CEO Robin Rombach, researchers who created Stability AI, considered a game-changing platform for image generation.\n\n\u201cRobin Rombach is known to be an absolute expert at image diffusion models and when you have someone that smart and proven in a brand new space, it makes it obvious one should invest if given the chance,\u201d one of the company\u2019s investors told TechCrunch.\n\nIt\u2019s not completely clear yet who is investing in the Freiburg, Germany-based startup\u2019s latest round. One source mentioned that Lightspeed \u2014 one of the more prolific investors in AI in Europe, backing Helsing, Mistral, Stability AI and others \u2014 might be involved. Lightspeed has not yet responded to a request for comment, and neither has Black Forest itself. (We will update the post if they do.)\n\nThe company\u2019s previous, $31 million round included a high-wattage list of investors. Led by Andreessen Horowitz, others, per PitchBook data, included General Catalyst and Stuttgart VC M\u00e4tch.vc, with Nvidia\u2019s Timo Aila, Oculus co-founder Brendan Iribe, Apple AI research scientist Vladlen Koltun, entertainment mogul Michael Ovitz, and Y Combinator\u2019s Garry Tan also in the mix.\n\nThe $1 billion valuation is a big jump on its post-money valuation from that last round, which was a more modest $150 million. (Asked about more funding, Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment for this story.)\n\nRapid fundraising in the area of generative AI has become quite commonplace in the current market: Startups building these tools need the funding to buy compute, to hire talent, perhaps to settle IP licensing agreements, and for marketing and business development to compete against bigger and even more well-funded players. In the case of Black Forest Labs, there are more technology launches coming up soon. The company has already said it\u2019s working on a state-of-the-art text-to-video tool, with an as-yet-unannounced debut date.\n\nBut the market has been tricky and sometimes unkind to some of the smaller AI players that have raised a lot and now have pressure to deliver. H in Paris, a generative AI startup started by DeepMind alums, raised $220 million in May of this year. It has already lost three of its five co-founders, allegedly over operational differences. Aleph Alpha, which has raised more than $500 million, appears to have pivoted to enterprise services over building foundational models.\n\n\u201cGetting into a headline position, being put into the spotlight, but not delivering,\u201d was how another investor who talked to TechCrunch described the predicament that companies like Aleph Alpha and H have faced.\n\nBlack Forest Labs will naturally try to avoid such issues, especially since \u2014 at least for the moment \u2014 it lacks a strategic investor that might prop it up with giant amounts of cash to grow more aggressively. Said this same investor: \u201cI think they will try to go down the other road, the one of staying as secretive as possible.\u201d",

        "title": "Shelf is a social network based on the media you consume",
        "text": "Social networks have become increasingly homogenous, showing everything from text to short videos across platforms, where algorithms often overshadow your creativity. In this ubiquitous environment, it\u2019s harder than ever to get a genuine sense of someone\u2019s vibe before deciding to follow them.\n\nEnter Shelf, an app that lets you create a personalized \u201cstorefront\u201d of your media habits, then connect with others based on the movies, shows, books, games, and music they consume. It also lets you track progress while reading your favorite book or watching a trending show.\n\n\u201cIf you observe culture at large on the internet, it\u2019s shifting away from posting selfies to here\u2019s what I\u2019m reading, watching, screenshots of the reviews of my movies and so on. It\u2019s essentially going deeper about a person, trying to understand what they\u2019re in \u2026 that\u2019s what Shelf is all about,\u201d said Jad Esber, co-founder and CEO of Koodos Labs, the startup behind Shelf, in an interview.\n\nEsber grew up writing online poetry anonymously, then spent the early years of his career at YouTube in London from 2015 to 2018. During this time, he worked on the creator side of the Google subsidiary, helping people create content, grow their audience, and monetize their work. This was when YouTube grew its creator ecosystem in various emerging markets outside the U.S.\n\nAfter spending over three years at Google, the Cambridge University master\u2019s graduate returned to academia, joining Harvard University to research consumer internet trends and study the internet academically. That eventually helped him conceptualize Shelf in a market full of social media apps with millions and billions of users.\n\n\u201cWe built many, many products,\u201d Esber told TechCrunch. \u201cThey all didn\u2019t work until Shelf, and Shelf emerged from those learnings.\u201d\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe Shelf app, available on iOS and Android, lets you connect your accounts associated with media, including Apple Music, Goodreads, Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube, then builds a customizable \u201cstorefront\u201d web page that updates automatically based on your consumption progress. You can also manually add links to any other internet service to your virtual shelf \u2014 even links to your favorite TechCrunch articles, which you can showcase to your followers.\n\nThe New York-based startup also plans to expand the list of supported services, including Steam for gamers.\n\n\u201c[A]s humans and as people online, we\u2019re very multi-hyphenate. We\u2019re not just into music, movies, shows, and all these things. Adding support for certain categories will expand the user base, but at the same time deepens the use case for existing users,\u201d Esber said.\n\nYou can choose a URL for the digital shelf based on your preference. Likewise, the app lets you customize the interface by changing the background color and moving items depending on your taste.\n\nKoodos plans to monetize Shelf by offering new customization options. It could also explore monetizing insights that the app surfaces, Esber told TechCrunch.\n\nUnlike apps that call the data using APIs, Shelf works regardless of whether the platform has a first-party API. Generally, when users select a third-party service like Spotify or Apple Music from the Shelf UI, they\u2019re signed in (either via a redirect to that app, or via a pop-up screen). Once the user has signed in, Esber can pull all the information about that user\u2019s media consumption directly from the app.\n\nEsber also stated that the startup does not use the data Shelf gets from the services users list on the app to train AI, which has become a common practice among online platforms nowadays.\n\nThis data-sharing is powered by a technology called DataMovers, and Koodos has been working with other apps to expand this solution as well (although Esber wouldn\u2019t say which ones). He compares DataMover with the data transfer network for fintech Plaid.\n\n\u201cIn a similar way [to Plaid], we\u2019re affording that user provision access to data to other applications, too,\u201d he said.\n\nImage Credits: Koodos Labs\n\nPrivate experience in testing\n\nAlongside letting users create their storefronts for the public, Shelf has begun testing a private experience for some users, who only want to track their own media consumption without sharing it.\n\n\u201cWe intend to be a fun utility that anyone can use over time. Everyone has a bookshelf in their living room or at home. So, why can\u2019t everyone have the Shelf?\u201d Esber said.\n\nLaunched publicly this summer after its beta testing at the end of last year, Shelf has added half a billion items by its users. Esber declined to share user numbers but said the number of shelves on the app is growing by 40% month-to-month and that users visit Shelf an average of five times a week to check in on or update their digital shelves or keep up with others\u2019 shelves.\n\nKoodos has raised $7 million in total from investors, including First Round Capital, M13, Blockchain Capital, and IDEO, as well as the founders of companies, including Zynga and VSCO. It also counts Pinterest co-founder Evan Sharp, Dubsmash co-founder (now Reddit VP) Suchit Dash, and the pioneers of market design at Harvard, Professors John Deighton and Scott Kominers.",

        "title": "The EU\u2019s 10 biggest antitrust actions on tech",
        "text": "The U.S. innovates and the EU regulates, or so certain transatlantic punters love to harp. We\u2019re not going to get embroiled in that noise here, but two things are clear: The bloc\u2019s Single Market has its own particular set of rules, and quite a lot of U.S. tech giants have run afoul of European Union competition regulations over the past several decades. Make of that what you will.\n\nEarlier this month, as she reveled in nailing a couple of major antitrust case appeals against Apple and Google, the EU\u2019s outgoing competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, jokingly referred to Big Tech as some of her best customers. Ouch.\n\nWe\u2019ve compiled a list of 10 of the biggest EU antitrust actions targeting tech to give a snapshot of the most high-profile \u2014 if not always consequential \u2014 competition skirmishes between Brussels and industry heavy hitters over the past several decades of digital development. The list is ordered based on the size of the fine or liability involved.\n\nWhile it\u2019s fair to say the EU\u2019s antitrust tech enforcement outcomes have varied, one lasting legacy is that some of these major cases served as inspiration for the bloc\u2019s Digital Markets Act: A flagship market contestability reform that could see major tech players hit harder and faster in the coming years. It\u2019s finally Big Tech\u2019s time to buckle up.\n\nIreland\u2019s tax breaks for Apple\n\nNo one enjoys paying their taxes, even less a demand for unpaid back taxes. But by September 2018, Apple had just finished handing the EU an eye-watering \u20ac13.1 billion (then worth $15.3 billion) after the bloc successfully sued one of its member states, Ireland, over illegal tax breaks granted to Apple between 1991 and 2014.\n\nThe State Aid case, which falls broadly under the bloc\u2019s competition rules, went back and forth through EU appeal courts. But in September 2024, the Court of Justice affirmed the original August 2016 Commission finding of unlawful State Aid.\n\nWith the top court weighing in with a final ruling (not a referral back to a lower court), Apple\u2019s legal options to continue challenging the decision are all but exhausted, and the billions in underpaid taxes sitting in an EU escrow account look set to finally pour into Ireland\u2019s coffers.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Android restrictions on OEMs\n\nMicromanaging the software that mobile device makers could bundle with its operating system, Android \u2014 to get its own wares in front of Android users regardless of the hardware they picked \u2014 got Google into costly hot water in the EU in recent years. Around $5 billion worth of antitrust heat, in fact. The 2018 Commission decision sanctioning it for abusing a dominant position was, and still is, a record-breaking penalty for this category of competition abuse.\n\nThe original EU \u20ac4.34 billion fine on Google was revised down slightly, to \u20ac4.125 billion, in a September 2022 appeal decision by the General Court. However, the judges largely upheld the original Commission decision, rejecting Google\u2019s bid to overturn the enforcement.\n\nGoogle\u2019s self-preferencing with Shopping\n\nBack in June 2017, Google was hit with another (at the time) record-breaking \u20ac2.42 billion penalty for abusing a dominant position \u2014 this one in relation to how it operated its product comparison service, Google Shopping (previously branded Google Product Search and, before that, the pun-tastic Froogle).\n\nThe bloc found that Google had not only unfairly favored its own (eponymous) shopping comparison service in organic search results, a market the tech giant has almost entirely sewn up in Europe, but had also actively demoted rival comparison services. The multi-billion-euro fine ensued \u2014 worth around $2.73 billion at the time it was announced \u2014 and was subsequently affirmed in a September 2024 decision by the EU\u2019s top court.\n\nApple\u2019s anti-steering on iOS music streaming\n\nThe EU branched into a competition theory of harm that accused Apple of consumer exploitation, rather than exclusionary conduct, in this long-running enforcement against Apple\u2019s conduct in the music streaming market on iOS.\n\nThe bloc\u2019s competition division changed tack a few times, as it investigated iOS developer complaints against the App Store operator. But in March 2024 it ended up hitting Apple with a \u20ac1.84 billion fine (around $2 billion) for banning developers from telling iPhone users about cheaper deals available outside Apple\u2019s store. The vast majority of the financial sanction \u2014 a full \u20ac1.8 billion \u2014 was applied on top of the EU\u2019s standard damages calculation, which the bloc said it hoped would act as a deterrent. (Without it, the fine would have been a mere \u20ac40 million \u2014 or a \u201cparking ticket\u201d level penalty for Big Tech.)\n\nGoogle\u2019s AdSense restrictions\n\nYet another billion+ antitrust penalty hit Google for abuse of dominance in March 2019, when the bloc sanctioned the company over its search ad brokering business. The Commission found it had used restrictive clauses in contracts with customers between 2006 and 2016 in a bid to squeeze out rival ad brokers. A penalty of \u20ac1.49 billion (or around $1.7 billion) was duly imposed.\n\nHowever, in September 2024, despite upholding the majority of the Commission\u2019s findings, the EU\u2019s General Court annulled the AdSense decision in its entirety over errors in how the Commission assessed the duration of Google\u2019s contracts. It remains to be seen whether the EU will appeal.\n\nThe Commission still has another (open) case probing Google\u2019s adtech stack more broadly, which could also make the AdSense case look like small beer. Margrethe Vestager warned last year that if the suspected violations are confirmed, a structural separation (i.e., breaking up Google) may be the only viable remedy.\n\nPC monitor and TV parts price-fixing cartel\n\nIn 2012, the EU handed down a total of \u20ac1.47 billion in fines in a cartels case related to the sale of components used in the manufacture of computer monitors and TVs. A raft of electronics giants were caught up in the enforcement over price-fixing of cathode ray tubes (CRT) between 1996 and 2006. The components were used in computer monitors and TVs in the pre-flatscreen era, and the Commission found that hardware makers had colluded to fix prices. Fines were handed down to seven electronics giants that were involved in either one or two CRT cartels, including LG, Panasonic, Philips, Samsung, and Toshiba.\n\nChipmaker Intel\u2019s exclusionary practices\n\nGoing further back in time, we arrive in May 2009, at what was then a record \u20ac1.06 billion antitrust penalty for chipmaker Intel after the EU found that the U.S. giant had abused a dominant position to exclude rival AMD. Intel had been paying computer manufacturers and retailers to postpone, cancel, or otherwise avoid using or selling AMD\u2019s products, and the EU found these exclusionary practices breached competition rules.\n\nThe chipmaker appealed the EU\u2019s enforcement with some success over the following decade of legal arguments. In 2017, the Court of Justice set aside an earlier ruling by a lower court and referred the case back to the General Court, which went on to annul part of the Commission\u2019s decision, while allowing that some of Intel\u2019s practices had been unlawful.\n\nThe Court quashed the original fine in its entirety, owing to uncertainty over the penalty calculation, but last year the EU reimposed a fine of \u20ac376.36 million on Intel \u2014 for the \u201cnaked restrictions\u201d that the Court had upheld. Appeals still rumble on, so where this enforcement finally ends up remains to be seen.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s deal with Apple for mobile chips\n\nIn early 2018, it was mobile chipmaker Qualcomm\u2019s turn to be hit with a beefy EU antitrust penalty: \u20ac997 million (or around $1.23 billion at the time). The sanction was for abuse of a dominant position between 2011 and 2016. The enforcement focused on Qualcomm\u2019s relationship with Apple, and the EU decided it had shut rival chipmakers out of the market for supplying LTE baseband chipsets by paying Apple to exclusively use its chips for iPhones and iPads.\n\nHowever, Qualcomm appealed the decision, and in June 2022 the EU General Court ruled in its favor, rejecting the Commission\u2019s analysis and also finding some procedural faults with its case. The EU later confirmed it would not appeal the judgment, so this is one sizable antitrust penalty that didn\u2019t make it beyond the headlines.\n\nThe bloc has had better luck in a separate (longer-running) antitrust procedure against the chipmaker: In September 2024, the General Court largely upheld a Commission penalty on Qualcomm of just under $270 million in a case related to predatory pricing.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s anti-competitive licensing practices\n\nWe have to wind back the clock all the way to March 2004 to arrive at the EU giving Microsoft a spanking for abusing a dominant position with its Windows operating system. The then-record \u20ac497 million penalty (around $794 million) would be worth closer to \u20ac762 million (or ~$1.3 billion) today, factoring in Eurozone inflation (per this tool).\n\nThe original complaint sparking the investigation into Microsoft\u2019s licensing and royalties practices dated all the way back to 1993. The EU\u2019s enforcement on Microsoft was upheld on appeal. As well as handing down a fine, the bloc ordered various remedies, including interoperability requirements, and a second, larger penalty of \u20ac899 million was handed down on Microsoft in February 2008 for noncompliance. A 2012 decision by the EU\u2019s General Court upheld the noncompliance penalty but reduced the level of the noncompliance fine slightly to \u20ac860 million.\n\nLuxembourg\u2019s tax deal with Amazon\n\nIn an October 2017 State Aid case, the EU argued that Luxembourg, the member state where e-commerce giant Amazon has its regional base, had granted the company \u201cundue tax benefits\u201d between May 2006 and June 2014. The Commission found that Amazon\u2019s corporate structure in the country had allowed it to pay four times less tax than other companies based there \u2014 a tax break the EU calculated was worth around \u20ac250 million. (The EU does not issue fines for State Aid cases but requires any unlawfully uncollected taxes to be recouped.)\n\nBut while the Commission took issue with Luxembourg\u2019s method of calculating Amazon\u2019s taxable profits in the country, unlike in the aforementioned Ireland-Apple State Aid case, its arguments did not prevail in court: In a final ruling late last year, the EU\u2019s top court struck down the Commission decision, finding that the EU had not established that the Luxembourg tax ruling was illegal State Aid. The upshot? Amazon was off the hook.",

        "text": "Chipmaker Qualcomm is trying to buy rival Intel, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal broke the news late Friday that Qualcomm had approached Intel about a takeover. The New York Times subsequently corroborated the story, while adding that no official offer has been made.\n\nEven if there is an offer, it\u2019s not clear whether Intel would accept it or if regulators would approve. (Qualcomm did not immediately responded to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment; Intel declined to comment.)\n\nOnce the industry leader, Intel has struggled due to a lack of mobile strategy. It reported a $1.6 billion loss in the second quarter of this year and has been implementing a $10 billion cost reduction plan that would eliminate 15,000 jobs. It\u2019s also moving to spin out its chip foundry business as an independent subsidiary.\n\nIntel currently has a market capitalization of around $90 billion, while Qualcomm\u2019s is around $190 billion. Both companies have been overshadowed recently by Nvidia as the AI boom drives demand for chips.",

        "text": "One of India\u2019s largest startups, budget hotel company Oyo, has reached a deal to acquire G6 Hospitality, which operates Motel 6.\n\nOyo says it will pay Blackstone Real Estate $525 million in an all-cash transaction. The acquisition also includes the Studio 6 extended stay brand and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year.\n\nThe Indian startup opened its first U.S. location in 2019 and now operates more than 320 hotels across 35 states. Oyo is dramatically expanding its North American footprint by acquiring Motel 6 \u2014 arguably the best-known budget hotel brand in the country, with a franchise network of around 1,500 locations in the United States and Canada.\n\n\u201cThis acquisition is a significant milestone for a startup company like us to strengthen our international presence,\u201d said Oyo International CEO Gautum Swaroop in a statement. He added that Motel 6 will \u201ccontinue to operate as a separate entity.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2012, SoftBank-backed Oyo\u2019s was valued at $10 billion in 2019, but has struggled in recent years due to pandemic-related challenges, as well as criticism over practices such as offering rooms from unavailable or unlicensed hotels.\n\nOver the summer, TechCrunch reported on a new funding round that saw the company\u2019s valuation fall to $2.5 billion \u2014 less than its total capital raised. (Oyo has denied reporting about its lowered valuation.)\n\nMotel 6, meanwhile, was founded in 1962.

        "title": "Electric outboard startup Pure Watercraft is selling itself for parts",
        "text": "A hopeful entrant in the emerging market of electric watercraft is out of action and being sold for parts.\n\nPure Watercraft was founded in 2011 with the intention of replacing gas-based outboard motors with fully electric ones. We covered the company in 2016 when it began taking preorders for its first commercial outboards, and in 2020 Pure raised $23 million to step up production. GM even took a 25% stake in Pure as part of its big investment in electric infrastructure.\n\nThe company offered a electric outboard and battery combo that could be mounted on a boat like any other outboard, or in a package with a rigid inflatable or pontoon boat. With prices ranging from $21,600 for just propulsion to nearly $100,000 for a full boat, Pure\u2019s products were arguably no more affordable up front than gas options, but they were certainly a lot cleaner and quieter.\n\nBut a tough market seems to have put an end to Pure\u2019s ambitions. The company entered receivership \u2014 a sort of alternative form of bankruptcy \u2014 in July, per filing documents in King County, Washington, where it is based. In August it was also reported that a planned multi-million-dollar factory in West Virginia would not be going forward.\n\nThe documents describe numerous creditors, from individual investors to banks to the big one, GM, which put approximately $35 million into the venture. That wasn\u2019t all cash, though: listed among Pure\u2019s assets is some $25 million worth of \u201cmanufacturing support,\u201d \u201cknow-how,\u201d licensing of the name, and other forms of non-pecuniary goods. (This type of in-kind investment is fairly commonplace.)\n\nOn the asset side, we find $3.6 million in \u201cfinished goods,\u201d likely the assembled motors and battery units built by Pure, though why those would not have gone out to the more than 900 people who paid a down payment is unclear (nor is whether refunds will be issued). Another $25.5 million of \u201craw materials\u201d is also listed, but what this may be is unclear \u2014 other documents detailing sale of assets like boats and batteries don\u2019t come near that sum.\n\nTechCrunch has asked both Pure and GM for comment on the matter. GM did not offer a substantive response and we have not yet heard back from Pure.\n\nElectric watercraft is a growing but still nascent industry, with startups like Candela, Navier, FleetZero and Zin Boats making a play for cleaner, more efficient waterways and infrastructure.",

        "title": "Moksha, the gamified meditation device, makes breath work exercises more engaging",
        "text": "Moksha\u2019s meditation tool aims to kick traditional breath work exercises to the curb.\n\nAs most breathing tools on the market are designed to do, Moksha aims to help train you to breathe longer and deeper, which studies have shown naturally calm you down, relax your muscles, slow your heart rate, and stabilize your blood pressure.\n\nThe smart breathing device \u2014 now available on the company\u2019s website after launching on Kickstarter last year with over 400 preorders \u2014 is a sleek metal pendant with a mouthpiece that you can inhale and exhale through. The idea for the Gamified Meditation Tool, as the company calls it, is that by inhaling and exhaling through a small cylindrical structure, you can better control and slow your breathing.\n\nYash Ghanekar and his co-founder Jaymin Shah came up with the idea for Moksha after dealing with some personal things that affected their mood and well-being. \u201cMy close friend had passed away, and it really triggered my anxiety to new heights. I always dealt with general anxiety and just the stress of school and social situations, but this took it to a new level, where I was having panic attacks night after night,\u201d Ghanekar told me.\n\nShah\u2019s brother, a doctor, told them about the benefits of breath work, and it inspired them to collaborate with R&D experts, data scientists, mechanical engineers, and designers to build their flagship device, the Beam, a $43 necklace with a metal pendant attached to it. It also comes with a free stand-alone app.\n\n\u201cThe feedback was remarkable. We got all kinds of people reaching out to us, saying that it saved their lives. People were coming to us with all kinds of collapsed lung disease conditions, with PTSD, with anxiety, and saying that this breath work tool is really helping them,\u201d Ghanekar said.\n\nAfter the success of its first device and app, the company decided to launch a smart tool that merges the two products.\n\nThe most unique selling point of the Gamified Meditation Tool is that it features air pressure sensors and haptic feedback technology to help beginners learn how to breathe and meditate properly. After inhaling for 2 to 8 seconds (depending on the type of meditation exercise) and then exhaling for 5.5 seconds, the device vibrates as a signal to begin inhaling again, eliminating the need to count in your head and helping you stay focused. This is indicated by a light buzzing feeling on your fingertips. When connected through Bluetooth, it can also track your breathing data.\n\nNotably, Moksha designed its device to resemble a vape or cigarette. The company hopes this will help redirect smokers from unhealthy habits. \u201cOur idea is to move everything away from this oral fixation of vapes and weed pens and move it more towards mental health,\u201d Ghanekar said.\n\nMoksha claims the device is nickel- and lead-free and doesn\u2019t contain \u201cchemicals or toxins that may injure your respiratory health.\u201d The mouthpiece can be removed for easy cleaning or replaced with a new one. Its portable charging case provides up to 60 hours of battery life.\n\nThe tool\u2019s companion iOS app offers breath control games, playlists, and meditation exercises to make breath work more engaging.\n\nThe app offers five breath work categories that all provide different benefits: Calm, Energy, Morning, Recovery, and Sleep. Each exercise follows a similar format: a brightly colored circle expands and contracts to help you center your breathing, accompanied by calming music or nature sounds in the background. It\u2019s the addition of the breathing tool that Moksha thinks will help people feel confident that they\u2019re doing the breath work correctly.\n\nAn enjoyable part of testing was playing the breath control game known as Copter. In this game, the player maneuvers a ball through the sky, dodging clouds by using controlled inhalation and exhalation to guide the ball up and down. While addictive, it reminded me that I should practice breath work more frequently. (Why was I so bad at something as basic as breathing?) It also reminded me of existing medical tools, such as the incentive spirometer, which acts as exercise equipment for patients to maintain strong lungs.\n\nSimilar to many traditional meditation apps, it monitors meditation sessions and maintains a daily log of users\u2019 moods and thoughts.\n\nImage Credits: Screenshots from App Store\n\nThe smart breathing device costs $150, which may seem like a steep price for something that gets you to do a thing you do every day for free. But the price is comparable to other meditation devices: Moonbird, which you hold in your hand, costs $199; and The Shift, another breathing device, retails for between $65 and $340, depending on the material it\u2019s made out of.\n\nI\u2019ve attended several breath meditation courses before in an attempt to alleviate my anxiety, but I always struggled to get into it and make it a regular habit to see real results. However, after using Moksha for nearly a month, I can say that it has made the practice a bit less boring for me. Admittedly, it\u2019s still not a daily part of my routine, but I find myself gravitating toward it before going to stressful events or to wind down after a long week. Moksha also has a new game launching soon, so I look forward to trying that out, too.\n\nThe handheld device can be used as a stand-alone product, but the app offers some free games and exercises. For $8 a month, you get access to its full library of over 500 breathing activities. Moksha\u2019s app also features a gamified reward system that offers discounts on coffee and clothing for users for simply using the app and, well, breathing. The company teamed up with Instacart, NBA Store, and Fanatics to offer coupons.\n\nThe company claims to have over $1 million in lifetime sales. To date, Moksha has raised a little under $200,000 from Republic and angel investors.",
